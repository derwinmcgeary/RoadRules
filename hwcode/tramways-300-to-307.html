<h1>4. Tramways (300 to 307)</h1>
</header>
<h2>300</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> enter a road, lane or other route
  reserved for trams. Take extra care where trams run along the road.
  You should avoid driving directly on top of the rails and should take
  care where trams leave the main carriageway to enter the reserved
  route, to ensure you do not follow them. The width taken up by trams
  is often shown by tram lanes marked by white lines, yellow dots or by
  a different type of road surface. Diamond-shaped signs and white
  light signals give instructions to tram drivers only.<br>

<h2>301</h2>

<p>Take extra care where the track crosses from one side of the road to
  the other and where the road narrows and the tracks come close to the
  kerb. Tram drivers usually have their own traffic signals and may be
  permitted to move when you are not. Always give way to trams. Do not
  try to race or overtake them or pass them on the inside, unless they
  are at tram stops or stopped by tram signals and there is a
  designated tram lane for you to pass.</p>

<h2>302</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> park your vehicle where it would get
  in the way of trams or where it would force other drivers to do so.
  Do not stop on any part of a tram track, except in a designated bay
  where this has been provided alongside and clear of the track. When
  doing so, ensure that all parts of your vehicle are outside the
  delineated tram path. Remember that a tram cannot steer round an
  obstruction.<br>

<h2>303</h2>

<p><strong>Tram stops.</strong> Where the tram stops at a platform,
  either in the middle or at the side of the road, you
  <strong>MUST</strong> follow the route shown by the road signs and
  markings. At stops without platforms you <strong>MUST NOT</strong>
  drive between a tram and the left-hand kerb when a tram has stopped
  to pick up passengers. If there is no alternative route signed, do
  not overtake the tram - wait until it moves off. <br>

<h2>304</h2>

<p>Look out for pedestrians, especially children, running to catch a
  tram approaching a stop.</p>

<h2>305</h2>

<p>Always give priority to trams, especially when they signal to pull
  away from stops, unless it would be unsafe to do so. Remember that
  they may be carrying large numbers of standing passengers who could
  be injured if the tram had to make an emergency stop. Look out for
  people getting off a bus or tram and crossing the road.</p>

<h2>306</h2>

<p>All road users, but particularly cyclists and motorcyclists, should
  take extra care when driving or riding close to or crossing the
  tracks, especially if the rails are wet. You should take particular
  care when crossing the rails at shallow angles, on bends and at
  junctions. It is safest to cross the tracks directly at right angles.
  Other road users should be aware that cyclists and motorcyclists may
  need more space to cross the tracks safely.</p>

<h2>307</h2>

<p><strong>Overhead electric lines.</strong> Tramway overhead wires are
  normally 5.8 metres above any carriageway, but can be lower. You
  should ensure that you have sufficient clearance between the wire and
  your vehicle (including any load you are carrying) before driving
  under an overhead wire. Drivers of vehicles with extending cranes,
  booms, tipping apparatus or other types of variable height equipment
  should ensure that the equipment is fully lowered. Where overhead
  wires are set lower than 5.8 metres, these will be indicated by
  height clearance markings - similar to &#8216;low bridge&#8217;
  signs. The height clearances on these plates should be carefully
  noted and observed. If you are in any doubt as to whether your
  vehicle will pass safely under the wires, you should always contact
  the local police or the tramway operator. Never take a chance as this
  can be extremely hazardous.</p>
