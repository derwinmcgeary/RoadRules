<h1>1. General guidance (83 to 88)</h1>
</header>
<p>These Rules are in addition to those in the following sections which
  apply to all vehicles. See Motorcycle licence requirements).</p>

<h2>83</h2>

<p>On all journeys, the rider and pillion passenger on a motorcycle,
  scooter or moped <strong>MUST</strong> wear a protective helmet. This
  does not apply to a follower of the Sikh religion while wearing a
  turban. Helmets <strong>MUST</strong> comply with the Regulations and
  they <strong>MUST</strong> be fastened securely. Riders and
  passengers of motor tricycles and quadricycles, also called
  quadbikes, should also wear a protective helmet. Before each journey
  check that your helmet visor is clean and in good condition.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sects 16 &amp; 17 &amp; MC(PH)R as amended reg
  4</strong></p>

<h2>84</h2>

<p>It is also advisable to wear eye protectors, which
  <strong>MUST</strong> comply with the Regulations. Scratched or
  poorly fitting eye protectors can limit your view when riding,
  particularly in bright sunshine and the hours of darkness. Consider
  wearing ear protection. Strong boots, gloves and suitable clothing
  may help to protect you if you are involved in a collision.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA sect 18 &amp; MC(EP)R as amended reg 4</strong></p>

<h2>85</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> carry more than one pillion passenger
  who <strong>MUST</strong> sit astride the machine on a proper seat.
  They should face forward with both feet on the footrests. You
  <strong>MUST NOT</strong> carry a pillion passenger unless your motor
  cycle is designed to do so. Provisional licence holders <strong>MUST
  NOT</strong> carry a pillion passenger.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 23, MV(DL)R 1999 reg 16(6) &amp; CUR 1986
  reg 102</strong></p>

<h2>86</h2>

<p><strong>Daylight riding.</strong> Make yourself as visible as
  possible from the side as well as the front and rear. You could wear
  a light or brightly coloured helmet and fluorescent clothing or
  strips. Dipped headlights, even in good daylight, may also make you
  more conspicuous. However, be aware that other vehicle drivers may
  still not have seen you, or judged your distance or speed correctly,
  especially at junctions.</p>

<h2>87</h2>

<p><strong>Riding in the dark.</strong> Wear reflective clothing or
  strips to improve your visibility in the dark. These reflect light
  from the headlamps of other vehicles, making you visible from a
  longer distance. See Rules 113&#8211;116 for lighting requirements.</p>

<h2>88</h2>

<p><strong>Manoeuvring.</strong> You should be aware of what is behind
  and to the sides before manoeuvring. Look behind you; use mirrors if
  they are fitted. When in traffic queues look out for pedestrians
  crossing between vehicles and vehicles emerging from junctions or
  changing lanes. Position yourself so that drivers in front can see
  you in their mirrors. Additionally, when filtering in slow-moving
  traffic, take care and keep your speed low.</p>

<p><strong>Remember: Observation &#8211; Signal &#8211;
  Manoeuvre.</strong></p>
