      <p>This Highway Code applies to England, Scotland and Wales. The
        Highway Code is essential reading for everyone.</p>

      <p>The most vulnerable road users are pedestrians, particularly
        children, older or disabled people, cyclists, motorcyclists and
        horse riders. It is important that all road users are aware of
        The Highway Code and are considerate towards each other. This
        applies to pedestrians as much as to drivers and riders.</p>

      <p>Many of the rules in The Highway Code are legal requirements,
        and if you disobey these rules you are committing a criminal
        offence. You may be fined, given penalty points on your licence
        or be disqualified from driving. In the most serious cases you
        may be sent to prison. Such rules are identified by the use of
        the words <strong>&#8216;MUST/MUST NOT&#8217;</strong>. In addition,
        the rule includes an abbreviated reference to the legislation
        which creates the offence. See an explanation
        of the abbreviations.</p>

      <p>Although failure to comply with the other rules of The Highway
        Code will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, The
        Highway Code may be used in evidence in any court proceedings
        under the Traffic Acts (see The
        road user and the law to establish liability. This includes
        rules which use advisory wording such as &#8216;should/should
        not&#8217; or &#8216;do/do not&#8217;.</p>

      <p>Knowing and applying the rules contained in The Highway Code
        could significantly reduce road casualties. Cutting the number
        of deaths and injuries that occur on our roads every day is a
        responsibility we all share. The Highway Code can help us
        discharge that responsibility. Further information on
        driving/riding techniques can be found in &#8216;The Official <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> Guide
        to Driving - the essential skills&#8217; and &#8216;The Official <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> Guide
