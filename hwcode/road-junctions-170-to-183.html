<h1>3. Road junctions (170 to 183)</h1>
</header>
<h2>170</h2>

<p>Take extra care at junctions. You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>watch out for cyclists, motorcyclists, powered
    wheelchairs/mobility scooters and pedestrians as they are not
    always easy to see. Be aware that they may not have seen or heard
    you if you are approaching from behind</li>

  <li>watch out for pedestrians crossing a road into which you are
    turning. If they have started to cross they have priority, so give
    way</li>

  <li>watch out for long vehicles which may be turning at a junction
    ahead; they may have to use the whole width of the road to make the
    turn (see Rule 221)</li>

  <li>watch out for horse riders who may take a different line on the
    road from that which you would expect</li>

  <li>not assume, when waiting at a junction, that a vehicle coming
    from the right and signalling left will actually turn. Wait and
    make sure</li>

  <li>look all around before emerging. Do not cross or join a road
    until there is a gap large enough for you to do so safely.</li>
</ul>

<h2>171</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> stop behind the line at a junction with a
  &#8216;Stop&#8217; sign and a solid white line across the road. Wait
  for a safe gap in the traffic before you move off.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10 &amp; 16</strong></p>

<h2>172</h2>

<p>The approach to a junction may have a &#8216;Give Way&#8217; sign or
  a triangle marked on the road. You <strong>MUST</strong> give way to
  traffic on the main road when emerging from a junction with broken
  white lines across the road.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10(1),16(1) &amp;
  25</strong></p>

<h2>173</h2>

<p><strong>Dual carriageways.</strong> When crossing or turning right,
  first assess whether the central reservation is deep enough to
  protect the full length of your vehicle.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If it is, then you should treat each half of the carriageway as a
    separate road. Wait in the central reservation until there is a
    safe gap in the traffic on the second half of the road.</li>

  <li>If the central reservation is too shallow for the length of your
    vehicle, wait until you can cross both carriageways in one go.</li>
</ul>

<h2>174</h2>

<p><strong>Box junctions.</strong> These have criss-cross yellow lines
  painted on the road (see &#8216;Road markings&#8217;). You
  <strong>MUST NOT</strong> enter the box until your exit road or lane
  is clear. However, you may enter the box and wait when you want to
  turn right, and are only stopped from doing so by oncoming traffic,
  or by other vehicles waiting to turn right. At signalled roundabouts
  you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> enter the box unless you can cross over
  it completely without stopping.<br>
  <strong>Law TSRGD regs 10(1) &amp; 29(2)</strong></p>

<h2>Junctions controlled by traffic lights</h2>

<h2>175</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> stop behind the white &#8216;Stop&#8217;
  line across your side of the road unless the light is green. If the
  amber light appears you may go on only if you have already crossed
  the stop line or are so close to it that to stop might cause a
  collision.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10 &amp; 36</strong></p>

<h2>176</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> move forward over the white line when
  the red light is showing. Only go forward when the traffic lights are
  green if there is room for you to clear the junction safely or you
  are taking up a position to turn right. If the traffic lights are not
  working, treat the situation as you would an unmarked junction and
  proceed with great care.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10 &amp; 36</strong></p>

<h2>177</h2>

<p><strong>Green filter arrow.</strong> This indicates a filter lane
  only. Do not enter that lane unless you want to go in the direction
  of the arrow. You may proceed in the direction of the green arrow
  when it, or the full green light shows. Give other traffic,
  especially cyclists, time and room to move into the correct lane.</p>

<h2>178</h2>

<p><strong>Advanced stop lines.</strong> Some signal-controlled
  junctions have advanced stop lines to allow cycles to be positioned
  ahead of other traffic. Motorists, including motorcyclists,
  <strong>MUST</strong> stop at the first white line reached if the
  lights are amber or red and should avoid blocking the way or
  encroaching on the marked area at other times, e.g. if the junction
  ahead is blocked. If your vehicle has proceeded over the first white
  line at the time that the signal goes red, you <strong>MUST</strong>
  stop at the second white line, even if your vehicle is in the marked
  area. Allow cyclists time and space to move off when the green signal
  shows.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10, 36(1) &amp;
  43(2)</strong></p>

<h2>Turning right</h2>

<h2>179</h2>

<p><strong>Well before</strong> you turn right you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>use your mirrors to make sure you know the position and movement
    of traffic behind you</li>

  <li>give a right-turn signal</li>

  <li>take up a position just left of the middle of the road or in the
    space marked for traffic turning right</li>

  <li>leave room for other vehicles to pass on the left, if possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2>180</h2>

<p>Wait until there is a safe gap between you and any oncoming vehicle.
  Watch out for cyclists, motorcyclists, pedestrians and other road
  users. Check your mirrors and blind spot again to make sure you are
  not being overtaken, then make the turn. Do not cut the corner. Take
  great care when turning into a main road; you will need to watch for
  traffic in both directions and wait for a safe gap.</p>

<p><strong>Remember: Mirrors &#8211; Signal &#8211; Manoeuvre</strong></p>

<h2>181</h2>

<p><strong>When turning</strong> right at crossroads where an oncoming
  vehicle is also turning right, there is a choice of two methods</p>

<ul>
  <li>turn right side to right side; keep the other vehicle on your
    right and turn behind it. This is generally the safer method as you
    have a clear view of any approaching traffic when completing your
    turn</li>

  <li>left side to left side, turning in front of each other. This can
    block your view of oncoming vehicles, so take extra care. Cyclists
    and motorcyclists in particular may be hidden from your view. Road
    layout, markings or how the other vehicle is positioned can
    determine which course should be taken.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Turning left</h2>

<h2>182</h2>

<p>Use your mirrors and give a left-turn signal well before you turn
  left. Do not overtake just before you turn left and watch out for
  traffic coming up on your left before you make the turn, especially
  if driving a large vehicle. Cyclists, motorcyclists and other road
  users in particular may be hidden from your view.</p>

<p><img alt="Highway Code - Rule 182 Do Not Cut In On Cyclists" src="hc_rule_182_do_not_cut_in_on_cyclists.jpg" width="100%"></p>

<h2>183</h2>

<p>When turning</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep as close to the left as is safe and practicable</li>

  <li>give way to any vehicles using a bus lane, cycle lane or tramway
    from either direction.</li>
</ul>
