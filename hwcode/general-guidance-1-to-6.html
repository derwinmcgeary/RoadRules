<h1>1. General guidance (1 to 6)</h1>
</header>
<h2>1</h2>

<p><strong>Pavements</strong> (including any path along the side of a
  road) should be used if provided. Where possible, avoid being next to
  the kerb with your back to the traffic. If you have to step into the
  road, look both ways first. Always show due care and consideration
  for others.</p>

<h2>2</h2>

<p><strong>If there is no pavement,</strong> keep to the right-hand
  side of the road so that you can see oncoming traffic. You should
  take extra care and</p>

<ul>
  <li>be prepared to walk in single file, especially on narrow roads or
    in poor light</li>

  <li>keep close to the side of the road.</li>
</ul>

<p>It may be safer to cross the road well before a sharp right-hand
  bend so that oncoming traffic has a better chance of seeing you.
  Cross back after the bend.</p>

<h2>3</h2>

<p><strong>Help other road users to see you.</strong> Wear or carry
  something light-coloured, bright or fluorescent in poor daylight
  conditions. When it is dark, use reflective materials (e.g. armbands,
  sashes, waistcoats, jackets, footwear), which can be seen by drivers
  using headlights up to three times as far away as non-reflective
  materials.</p>

<h2>4</h2>

<p><strong>Young children</strong> should not be out alone on the
  pavement or road (see Rule 7). When taking children out, keep between
  them and the traffic and hold their hands firmly. Strap very young
  children into push-chairs or use reins. When pushing a young child in
  a buggy, do not push the buggy into the road when checking to see if
  it is clear to cross, particularly from between parked vehicles.</p>

<h2>5</h2>

<p><strong>Organised walks.</strong> Large groups of people walking
  together should use a pavement if available; if one is not, they
  should keep to the left. Look-outs should be positioned at the front
  and back of the group, and they should wear fluorescent clothes in
  daylight and reflective clothes in the dark. At night, the look-out
  in front should show a white light and the one at the back a red
  light. People on the outside of large groups should also carry lights
  and wear reflective clothing.</p>

<h2>6</h2>

<p><strong>Motorways.</strong> Pedestrians <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be
  on motorways or slip roads except in an emergency (see Rule 271 and
  Rule 275).<br>
