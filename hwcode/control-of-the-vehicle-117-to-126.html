<h1>5. Control of the vehicle (117 to 126)</h1>
</header>
<h2>Braking</h2>

<h2>117</h2>

<p><strong>In normal circumstances.</strong> The safest way to brake is
  to do so early and lightly. Brake more firmly as you begin to stop.
  Ease the pressure off just before the vehicle comes to rest to avoid
  a jerky stop.</p>

<h2>118</h2>

<p><strong>In an emergency.</strong> Brake immediately. Try to avoid
  braking so harshly that you lock your wheels. Locked wheels can lead
  to loss of control.</p>

<h2>119</h2>

<p><strong>Skids.</strong> Skidding is usually caused by the driver
  braking, accelerating or steering too harshly or driving too fast for
  the road conditions. If skidding occurs, remove the cause by
  releasing the brake pedal fully or easing off the accelerator. Turn
  the steering wheel in the direction of the skid. For example, if the
  rear of the vehicle skids to the right, steer immediately to the
  right to recover.</p>

<h2>120</h2>

<p><strong>ABS.</strong> If your vehicle is fitted with anti-lock
  brakes, you should follow the advice given in the vehicle handbook.
  However, in the case of an emergency, apply the footbrake firmly; do
  not release the pressure until the vehicle has slowed to the desired
  speed. The ABS should ensure that steering control will be retained,
  but do not assume that a vehicle with ABS will stop in a shorter
  distance.</p>

<h2>121</h2>

<p><strong>Brakes affected by water.</strong> If you have driven
  through deep water your brakes may be less effective. Test them at
  the first safe opportunity by pushing gently on the brake pedal to
  make sure that they work. If they are not fully effective, gently
  apply light pressure while driving slowly. This will help to dry them
  out.</p>

<h2>122</h2>

<p><strong>Coasting.</strong> This term describes a vehicle travelling
  in neutral or with the clutch pressed down. It can reduce driver
  control because</p>

<ul>
  <li>engine braking is eliminated</li>

  <li>vehicle speed downhill will increase quickly</li>

  <li>increased use of the footbrake can reduce its effectiveness</li>

  <li>steering response will be affected, particularly on bends and
    corners</li>

  <li>it may be more difficult to select the appropriate gear when
    needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Driver and the Environment</h2>

<h2>123</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> leave a parked vehicle unattended with
  the engine running or leave a vehicle engine running unnecessarily
  while that vehicle is stationary on a public road. Generally, if the
  vehicle is stationary and is likely to remain so for more than a
  couple of minutes, you should apply the parking brake and switch off
  the engine to reduce emissions and noise pollution. However it is
  permissible to leave the engine running if the vehicle is stationary
  in traffic or for diagnosing faults.<br>

<p>*The 30 mph limit usually applies to all traffic on all roads with
  street lighting unless signs show otherwise. &#8224;60 mph (96 km/h)
  if articulated or towing a trailer</p>

<h2>Speed limits</h2>

<h2>124</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> exceed the maximum speed limits for
  the road and for your vehicle (see the table above). The presence of
  street lights generally means that there is a 30 mph (48 km/h) speed
  limit unless otherwise specified.<br>
  <strong>Law RTRA sects 81, 86, 89 &amp; sch 6 (as amended by the
  MV(VSL)(E&amp;W) regs 2014)</strong></p>

<h2>125</h2>

<p>The speed limit is the absolute maximum and does not mean it is safe
  to drive at that speed irrespective of conditions. Driving at speeds
  too fast for the road and traffic conditions is dangerous. You should
  always reduce your speed when</p>

<ul>
  <li>the road layout or condition presents hazards, such as bends</li>

  <li>sharing the road with pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders,
    particularly children, and motorcyclists</li>

  <li>weather conditions make it safer to do so</li>

  <li>driving at night as it is more difficult to see other road users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>126</h2>

<p><strong>Stopping Distances.</strong> Drive at a speed that will
  allow you to stop well within the distance you can see to be clear.
  You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>leave enough space between you and the vehicle in front so that
    you can pull up safely if it suddenly slows down or stops. The safe
    rule is never to get closer than the overall stopping distance (see
    Typical Stopping Distances diagram, shown below)</li>

  <li>allow at least a two-second gap between you and the vehicle in
    front on roads carrying faster-moving traffic and in tunnels where
    visibility is reduced. The gap should be at least doubled on wet
    roads and increased still further on icy roads</li>

  <li>remember, large vehicles and motorcycles need a greater distance
    to stop. If driving a large vehicle in a tunnel, you should allow a
    four-second gap between you and the vehicle in front.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have to stop in a tunnel, leave at least a 5-metre gap
  between you and the vehicle in front.</p>
