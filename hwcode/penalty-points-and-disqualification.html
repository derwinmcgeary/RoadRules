<h1>2. Penalty points and disqualification</h1>
</header>
<p>The penalty point system is intended to deter drivers and
  motorcyclists from following unsafe motoring practices. Certain
  non-motoring offences, e.g. failure to rectify vehicle defects, can
  also attract penalty points.</p>

<p>The court <strong>MUST</strong> order points to be endorsed on the
  licence according to the fixed number or the range set by Parliament.
  The accumulation of penalty points acts as a warning to drivers and
  motorcyclists that they risk disqualification if further offences are
  committed.<br>
  <strong>Law RTOA sects 44 &amp; 45</strong></p>

<p>A driver or motorcyclist who accumulates 12 or more penalty points
  within a 3-year period <strong>MUST</strong> be disqualified. This
  will be for a minimum period of 6 months, or longer if the driver or
  motorcyclist has previously been disqualified.<br>
  <strong>Law RTOA sect 35</strong></p>

<p>For every offence which carries penalty points the court has a
  discretionary power to order the licence holder to be disqualified.
  This may be for any period the court thinks fit, but will usually be
  between a week and a few months.</p>

<p>In the case of serious offences, such as dangerous driving and
  drink-driving, the court <strong>MUST</strong> order
  disqualification. The minimum period is 12 months, but for repeat
  offenders or where the alcohol level is high, it may be longer. For
  example, a second drink-drive offence in the space of 10 years will
  result in a minimum of 3 years&#8217; disqualification. <br>
