<h2>264</h2>

<p>You should always drive in the left-hand lane when the road ahead is
  clear. If you are overtaking a number of slower-moving vehicles, you
  should return to the left-hand lane as soon as you are safely past.
  Slow-moving or speed-restricted vehicles should always remain in the
  left-hand lane of the carriageway unless overtaking. You <strong>MUST
  NOT</strong> drive on the hard shoulder except in an emergency or if
  directed to do so by the police, traffic officers in uniform or by
  signs.</p>

<p><strong>Approaching a junction.</strong> Look well ahead for signals
  or signs. Direction signs may be placed over the road. If you need to
  change lanes, do so in good time. At some junctions a lane may lead
  directly off the motorway. Only get in that lane if you wish to go in
  the direction indicated on the overhead signs.</p>
