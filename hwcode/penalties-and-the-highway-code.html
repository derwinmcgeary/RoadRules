<h1>1. Penalties and the Highway Code</h1>
</header>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
  <p>This Highway Code applies to England, Scotland and Wales. The
    Highway Code is essential reading for everyone.</p>
</div>

<p>Parliament sets the maximum penalties for road traffic offences. The
  seriousness of the offence is reflected in the maximum penalty. It is
  for the courts to decide what sentence to impose according to
  circumstances.</p>

<p>The penalty table indicates some of the main offences, and the
  associated penalties. There is a wide range of other more specific
  offences which, for the sake of simplicity, are not shown here. The
  penalty points and disqualification system is described below.</p>
