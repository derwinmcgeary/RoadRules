<h1>2. Signals (103 to 106)</h1>
</header>
<h2>103</h2>

<p>Signals warn and inform other road users, including pedestrians (see
  &#8216;Signals to other road users&#8217;), of your intended actions.
  You should always</p>

<ul>
  <li>give clear signals in plenty of time, having checked it is not
    misleading to signal at that time</li>

  <li>use them to advise other road users before changing course or
    direction, stopping or moving off</li>

  <li>cancel them after use</li>

  <li>make sure your signals will not confuse others. If, for instance,
    you want to stop after a side road, do not signal until you are
    passing the road. If you signal earlier it may give the impression
    that you intend to turn into the road. Your brake lights will warn
    traffic behind you that you are slowing down</li>

  <li>use an arm signal to emphasise or reinforce your signal if
    necessary. Remember that signalling does not give you priority.</li>
</ul>

<h2>104</h2>

<p>You should also</p>

<ul>
  <li>watch out for signals given by other road users and proceed only
    when you are satisfied that it is safe</li>

  <li>be aware that an indicator on another vehicle may not have been
    cancelled.</li>
</ul>

<h2>105</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> obey signals given by police officers,
  traffic officers, traffic wardens (see &#8216;Signals by authorised
  persons&#8217;). and signs used by school crossing patrols.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTRA sect 28, RTA 1988 sect 35, TMA 2004 sect 6, &amp;
  FTWO art 3</strong></p>

<h2>106</h2>

<p><strong>Police stopping procedures.</strong> If the police want to
  stop your vehicle they will, where possible, attract your attention
  by</p>

<ul>
  <li>flashing blue lights, headlights or sounding their siren or horn,
    usually from behind</li>

  <li>directing you to pull over to the side by pointing and/or using
    the left indicator.</li>
</ul>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> then pull over and stop as soon as it is
  safe to do so. Then switch off your engine.<br>
