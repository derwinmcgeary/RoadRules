<h1>4. Situations needing extra care (31 to 35)</h1>
</header>
<h2>31</h2>

<p><strong>Emergency vehicles.</strong> If an ambulance, fire engine,
  police or other emergency vehicle approaches using flashing blue
  lights, headlights and/or sirens, keep off the road.</p>

<h2>32</h2>

<p><strong>Buses.</strong> Get on or off a bus only when it has stopped
  to allow you to do so. Watch out for cyclists when you are getting
  off. Never cross the road directly behind or in front of a bus. Wait
  until it has moved off and you can see clearly in both directions.</p>

<h2>33</h2>

<p><strong>Tramways.</strong> These may run through pedestrian areas.
  Their path will be marked out by shallow kerbs, changes in the paving
  or other road surface, white lines or yellow dots. Cross at
  designated crossings where provided. Elsewhere treat trams as you
  would other road vehicles and look both ways along the track before
  crossing. Do not walk along the track as trams may come up behind
  you. Trams move quietly and cannot steer to avoid you.</p>

<h2>34</h2>

<p><strong>Railway level crossings.</strong> You <strong>MUST
  NOT</strong> cross or pass a stop line when the red lights show,
  (including a red pedestrian figure). Also do not cross if an alarm is
  sounding or the barriers are being lowered. The tone of the alarm may
  change if another train is approaching. If there are no lights,
  alarms or barriers, stop, look both ways and listen before crossing.
  A tactile surface comprising rounded bars running across the
  direction of pedestrian travel may be installed on the footpath
  approaching a level crossing to warn visually impaired people of its
  presence. The tactile surface should extend across the full width of
  the footway and should be located at an appropriate distance from the
  barrier or projected line of the barrier.<br>
  <strong>Law TSRGD, reg 52</strong></p>

<h2>35</h2>

<p><strong>Street and pavement repairs.</strong> A pavement may be
  closed temporarily because it is not safe to use. Take extra care if
  you are directed to walk in or to cross the road.</p>
