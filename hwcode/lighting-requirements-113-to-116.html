<h1>4. Lighting requirements (113 to 116)</h1>
</header>
<h2>113</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure all sidelights and rear registration plate lights are lit
    between sunset and sunrise</li>

  <li>use headlights at night, except on a road which has lit street
    lighting. These roads are generally restricted to a speed limit of
    30 mph (48 km/h) unless otherwise specified</li>

  <li>use headlights when visibility is seriously reduced (see Rule
    226).</li>
</ul>

<p>Night (the hours of darkness) is defined as the period between half
  an hour after sunset and half an hour before sunrise).<br>
  <strong>Laws RVLR regs 3, 24, &amp; 25, (In Scotland - RTRA 1984 sect
  82 (as amended by NRSWA, para 59 of sched 8))</strong></p>

<h2>114</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>use any lights in a way which would dazzle or cause discomfort to
    other road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders</li>

  <li>use front or rear fog lights unless visibility is seriously
    reduced. You <strong>MUST</strong> switch them off when visibility
    improves to avoid dazzling other road users (see Rule 226).</li>
</ul>

<p>In stationary queues of traffic, drivers should apply the parking
  brake and, once the following traffic has stopped, take their foot
  off the footbrake to deactivate the vehicle brake lights. This will
  minimise glare to road users behind until the traffic moves
  again.<br>
  <strong>Law RVLR reg 27</strong></p>

<h2>115</h2>

<p>You should also</p>

<ul>
  <li>use dipped headlights, or dim-dip if fitted, at night in built-up
    areas and in dull daytime weather, to ensure that you can be seen</li>

  <li>keep your headlights dipped when overtaking until you are level
    with the other vehicle and then change to main beam if necessary,
    unless this would dazzle oncoming road users</li>

  <li>slow down, and if necessary stop, if you are dazzled by oncoming
    headlights</li>
</ul>

<h2>116</h2>

<p><strong>Hazard warning lights.</strong> These may be used when your
  vehicle is stationary, to warn that it is temporarily obstructing
  traffic. Never use them as an excuse for dangerous or illegal
  parking. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use hazard warning lights
  while driving or being towed unless you are on a motorway or
  unrestricted dual carriageway and you need to warn drivers behind you
  of a hazard or obstruction ahead. Only use them for long enough to
  ensure that your warning has been observed.<br>
