<h1>6. Lines and lane markings on the road (127 to 132)</h1>
</header>
<p>See &#8216;Road markings&#8217; to see diagrams of all lines.</p>

<h2>127</h2>

<p><strong>A broken white line.</strong> This marks the centre of the
  road. When this line lengthens and the gaps shorten, it means that
  there is a hazard ahead. Do not cross it unless you can see the road
  is clear and wish to overtake or turn off.</p>

<h2>128</h2>

<p><strong>Double white lines where the line nearest to you is
  broken.</strong> This means you may cross the lines to overtake if it
  is safe, provided you can complete the manoeuvre before reaching a
  solid white line on your side. White direction arrows on the road
  indicate that you need to get back onto your side of the road.</p>

<h2>129</h2>

<p><strong>Double white lines where the line nearest you is
  solid.</strong> This means you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> cross or
  straddle it unless it is safe and you need to enter adjoining
  premises or a side road. You may cross the line if necessary,
  provided the road is clear, to pass a stationary vehicle, or overtake
  a pedal cycle, horse or road maintenance vehicle, if they are
  travelling at 10 mph (16 km/h) or less.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10 &amp; 26</strong></p>

<h2>130</h2>

<p><strong>Areas of white diagonal stripes</strong> or chevrons painted
  on the road. These are to separate traffic lanes or to protect
  traffic turning right.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the area is bordered by a broken white line, you should not
    enter the area unless it is necessary and you can see that it is
    safe to do so.</li>

  <li>If the area is marked with chevrons and bordered by solid white
    lines you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> enter it except in an
    emergency.<br>

    9 &amp; 14, RTA sect 36 &amp; TSRGD 10(1)</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>131</h2>

<p><strong>Lane dividers.</strong> These are short, broken white lines
  which are used on wide carriageways to divide them into lanes. You
  should keep between them.</p>

<h2>132</h2>

<p><strong>Reflective road studs</strong> may be used with white lines.</p>

<ul>
  <li>White studs mark the lanes or the middle of the road.</li>

  <li>Red studs mark the left edge of the road.</li>

  <li>Amber studs mark the central reservation of a dual carriageway or
    motorway.</li>

  <li>Green studs mark the edge of the main carriageway at lay-bys and
    slip roads.</li>

  <li>Green/yellow studs indicate temporary adjustments to lane
    layouts, e.g. where road works are taking place.</li>
</ul>
