<p>* Where a court disqualifies a person on conviction for one of these
  offences, it must order an extended retest. The courts also have
  discretion to order a retest for any other offence which carries
  penalty points, an extended retest where disqualification is
  obligatory, and an ordinary test where disqualification is not
  obligatory.</p>
