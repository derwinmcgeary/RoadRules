<h1>2. Additional rules for high-speed roads (289 to 290)</h1>
</header>
<h2>289</h2>

<p>Take special care on motorways and other high-speed dual
  carriageways.</p>

<ul>
  <li>One or more lanes may be closed to traffic and a lower speed
    limit may apply.</li>

  <li>Works vehicles that are slow moving or stationary with a large
    &#8216;Keep Left&#8217; or &#8216;Keep Right&#8217; sign on the
    back are sometimes used to close lanes for repairs, and a flashing
    light arrow may also be used to make the works vehicle more
    conspicuous from a distance and give earlier warning to drivers
    that they need to move over to the next lane.</li>

  <li>Check mirrors, slow down and change lanes if necessary.</li>

  <li>Keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front (see Rule 126).</li>
</ul>

<h2>290</h2>

<p>Contraflow systems mean that you may be travelling in a narrower
  lane than normal and with no permanent barrier between you and
  oncoming traffic. The hard shoulder may be used for traffic, but be
  aware that there may be broken-down vehicles ahead of you. Keep a
  good distance from the vehicle ahead and observe any temporary speed
  limits.</p>
