<p><strong>At night.</strong> It is safer not to ride on the road at
  night or in poor visibility, but if you do, make sure you wear
  reflective clothing and your horse has reflective bands above the
  fetlock joints. A light which shows white to the front and red to the
  rear should be fitted, with a band, to the rider&#8217;s right arm
  and/or leg/riding boot. If you are leading a horse at night, carry a
  light in your right hand, showing white to the front and red to the
  rear, and wear reflective clothing on both you and your horse. It is
  strongly recommended that a fluorescent/reflective tail guard is also
  worn by your horse.</p>

<h2>Riding</h2>

<h2>52</h2>

<p>Before you take a horse on to a road, you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure all tack fits well and is in good condition</li>

  <li>make sure you can control the horse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Always ride with other, less nervous horses if you think that your
  horse will be nervous of traffic. Never ride a horse without both a
  saddle and bridle.</p>

<h2>53</h2>

<p>Before riding off or turning, look behind you to make sure it is
  safe, then give a clear arm signal.</p>

<p>When riding on the road you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep to the left</li>

  <li>keep both hands on the reins unless you are signalling</li>

  <li>keep both feet in the stirrups</li>

  <li>not carry another person</li>

  <li>not carry anything which might affect your balance or get tangled
    up with the reins</li>

  <li>keep a horse you are leading to your left</li>

  <li>move in the direction of the traffic flow in a one-way street</li>

  <li>never ride more than two abreast, and ride in single file on
    narrow or busy roads and when riding round bends.</li>
</ul>

<h2>54</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> take a horse onto a footpath or
  pavement, and you should not take a horse onto a cycle track. Use a
  bridleway where possible. Equestrian crossings may be provided for
  horse riders to cross the road and you should use these where
  available (see Crossings). You should dismount at level crossings
  where a &#8216;horse rider dismount&#8217; sign is displayed.<br>
  <strong>Laws HA 1835 sect 72, R(S)A 1984, sect 129(5)</strong></p>

<h2>55</h2>

<p>Avoid roundabouts wherever possible. If you use them you should -
  keep to the left and watch out for vehicles crossing your path to
  leave or join the roundabout - signal right when riding across exits
  to show you are not leaving - signal left just before you leave the
  roundabout.</p>
