<h1>2. Wet weather (227)</h1>
</header>
<h2>227</h2>

<p><strong>Wet weather.</strong> In wet weather, stopping distances
  will be at least double those required for stopping on dry roads (see
  &#8216;Typical stopping distances). This is because your tyres have
  less grip on the road. In wet weather</p>

<ul>
  <li>you should keep well back from the vehicle in front. This will
    increase your ability to see and plan ahead</li>

  <li>if the steering becomes unresponsive, it probably means that
    water is preventing the tyres from gripping the road. Ease off the
    accelerator and slow down gradually</li>

  <li>the rain and spray from vehicles may make it difficult to see and
    be seen</li>

  <li>be aware of the dangers of spilt diesel that will make the
    surface very slippery (see Annex 6: Vehicle maintenance, safety and
    security)</li>

  <li>take extra care around pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and
    horse riders.</li>
