<h1>4. Roundabouts (184 to 190)</h1>
</header>
<h2>184</h2>

<p><strong>On approaching a roundabout</strong> take notice and act on
  all the information available to you, including traffic signs,
  traffic lights and lane markings which direct you into the correct
  lane. You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>use <strong>Mirrors &#8211; Signal &#8211; Manoeuvre</strong> at
    all stages</li>

  <li>decide as early as possible which exit you need to take</li>

  <li>give an appropriate signal (see Rule 186, below). Time your
    signals so as not to confuse other road users</li>

  <li>get into the correct lane</li>

  <li>adjust your speed and position to fit in with traffic conditions</li>

  <li>be aware of the speed and position of all the road users around
    you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>185</h2>

<p><strong>When reaching the roundabout</strong> you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>give priority to traffic approaching from your right, unless
    directed otherwise by signs, road markings or traffic lights</li>

  <li>check whether road markings allow you to enter the roundabout
    without giving way. If so, proceed, but still look to the right
    before joining</li>

  <li>watch out for all other road users already on the roundabout; be
    aware they may not be signalling correctly or at all</li>

  <li>look forward before moving off to make sure traffic in front has
    moved off.</li>
</ul>

<h2>186</h2>

<p><strong>Signals and position</strong></p>

<p>When taking the first exit to the left, unless signs or markings
  indicate otherwise</p>

<ul>
  <li>signal left and approach in the left-hand lane</li>

  <li>keep to the left on the roundabout and continue signalling left
    to leave.</li>
</ul>

<p>When taking an exit to the right or going full circle, unless signs
  or markings indicate otherwise</p>

<ul>
  <li>signal right and approach in the right-hand lane</li>

  <li>keep to the right on the roundabout until you need to change
    lanes to exit the roundabout</li>

  <li>signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you
    want.</li>
</ul>

<p>When taking any intermediate exit, unless signs or markings indicate
  otherwise</p>

<ul>
  <li>select the appropriate lane on approach to and on the roundabout</li>

  <li>you should not normally need to signal on approach</li>

  <li>stay in this lane until you need to alter course to exit the
    roundabout</li>

  <li>signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you
    want.</li>
</ul>

<p>When there are more than three lanes at the entrance to a
  roundabout, use the most appropriate lane on approach and through it.</p>

<h2>187</h2>

<p><strong>In all cases watch out for</strong> and give plenty of room
  to</p>

<ul>
  <li>pedestrians who may be crossing the approach and exit roads</li>

  <li>traffic crossing in front of you on the roundabout, especially
    vehicles intending to leave by the next exit</li>

  <li>traffic which may be straddling lanes or positioned incorrectly</li>

  <li>motorcyclists</li>

  <li>cyclists and horse riders who may stay in the left-hand lane and
    signal right if they intend to continue round the roundabout. Allow
    them to do so</li>

  <li>long vehicles (including those towing trailers). These might have
    to take a different course or straddle lanes either approaching or
    on the roundabout because of their length. Watch out for their
    signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>188</h2>

<p><strong>Mini-roundabouts.</strong> Approach these in the same way as
  normal roundabouts. All vehicles <strong>MUST</strong> pass round the
  central markings except large vehicles which are physically incapable
  of doing so. Remember, there is less space to manoeuvre and less time
  to signal. Avoid making U-turns at mini-roundabouts. Beware of others
  doing this.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10(1) &amp;
  16(1)</strong></p>

<h2>189</h2>

<p>At double mini-roundabouts treat each roundabout separately and give
  way to traffic from the right.</p>

<h2>190</h2>

<p><strong>Multiple roundabouts.</strong> At some complex junctions,
  there may be a series of mini-roundabouts at each intersection. Treat
  each mini-roundabout separately and follow the normal rules.</p>
