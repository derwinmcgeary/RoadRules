<h1>3. Motorcyclists and cyclists (211 to 213)</h1>
</header>
<h2>211</h2>

<p>It is often difficult to see motorcyclists and cyclists, especially
  when they are coming up from behind, coming out of junctions, at
  roundabouts, overtaking you or filtering through traffic. Always look
  out for them before you emerge from a junction; they could be
  approaching faster than you think. When turning right across a line
  of slow-moving or stationary traffic, look out for cyclists or
  motorcyclists on the inside of the traffic you are crossing. Be
  especially careful when turning, and when changing direction or lane.
  Be sure to check mirrors and blind spots carefully.</p>

<h2>212</h2>

<p>When passing motorcyclists and cyclists, give them plenty of room
  (see Rules 162 to 167). If they look over their shoulder it could
  mean that they intend to pull out, turn right or change direction.
  Give them time and space to do so.</p>

<h2>213</h2>

<p>Motorcyclists and cyclists may suddenly need to avoid uneven road
  surfaces and obstacles such as drain covers or oily, wet or icy
  patches on the road. Give them plenty of room and pay particular
  attention to any sudden change of direction they may have to make.</p>
