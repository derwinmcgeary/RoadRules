<h1>6. Reversing (200 to 203)</h1>
</header>
<h2>200</h2>

<p>Choose an appropriate place to manoeuvre. If you need to turn your
  vehicle around, wait until you find a safe place. Try not to reverse
  or turn round in a busy road; find a quiet side road or drive round a
  block of side streets.</p>

<h2>201</h2>

<p>Do not reverse from a side road into a main road. When using a
  driveway, reverse in and drive out if you can.</p>

<h2>202</h2>

<p>Look carefully before you start reversing. You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>use all your mirrors</li>

  <li>check the &#8216;blind spot&#8217; behind you (the part of the
    road you cannot see easily in the mirrors)</li>

  <li>check there are no pedestrians (particularly children), cyclists,
    other road users or obstructions in the road behind you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reverse slowly while</p>

<ul>
  <li>checking all around</li>

  <li>looking mainly through the rear window</li>

  <li>being aware that the front of your vehicle will swing out as you
    turn.</li>
</ul>

<p>Get someone to guide you if you cannot see clearly.</p>

<h2>203</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> reverse your vehicle further than
  necessary.<br>
