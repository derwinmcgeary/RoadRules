<h1>4. Incidents (281 to 283)</h1>
</header>
<h2>281</h2>

<p><strong>Warning signs or flashing lights.</strong> If you see or
  hear emergency or incident support vehicles in the distance, be aware
  there may be an incident ahead (see Rule 219). Police officers and
  traffic officers may be required to work in the carriageway, for
  example dealing with debris, collisions or conducting rolling road
  blocks. Police officers will use rear-facing flashing red and blue
  lights and traffic officers will use rear-facing flashing red and
  amber lights in these situations. Watch out for such signals, slow
  down and be prepared to stop. You <strong>MUST</strong> follow any
  directions given by police officers or traffic officers as to whether
  you can safely pass the incident or blockage.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA1988, sects 35 &amp; 163, and as amended by TMA 2004,
  sect 6</strong></p>

<h2>282</h2>

<p>When passing the scene of an incident or crash do not be distracted
  or slow down unnecessarily (for example if an incident is on the
  other side of a dual carriageway). This may cause a collision or
  traffic congestion, but see Rule 283, below.</p>

<h2>283</h2>

<p>If you are involved in a crash or stop to give assistance</p>

<ul>
  <li>use your hazard warning lights to warn other traffic</li>

  <li>ask drivers to switch off their engines and stop smoking</li>

  <li>arrange for the emergency services to be called immediately with
    full details of the incident location and any casualties (on a
    motorway, use the emergency telephone which allows easy location by
    the emergency services. If you use a mobile phone, first make sure
    you have identified your location from the marker posts on the side
    of the hard shoulder)</li>

  <li>move uninjured people away from the vehicles to safety; on a
    motorway this should, if possible, be well away from the traffic,
    the hard shoulder and the central reservation</li>

  <li>do not move injured people from their vehicles unless they are in
    immediate danger from fire or explosion</li>

  <li>do not remove a motorcyclist&#8217;s helmet unless it is
    essential to do so</li>

  <li>be prepared to give first aid</li>

  <li>stay at the scene until emergency services arrive. If you are
    involved in any other medical emergency on the motorway you should
    contact the emergency services in the same way.</li>
</ul>
