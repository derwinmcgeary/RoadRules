<h1>3. Level crossings (291 to 299)</h1>
</header>
<h2>291</h2>

<p>A level crossing is where a road crosses a railway or tramway line.
  Approach and cross it with care. Never drive onto a crossing until
  the road is clear on the other side and do not get too close to the
  car in front. Never stop or park on, or near, a crossing.</p>

<h2>Overhead electric lines</h2>

<h2>292</h2>

<p>It is dangerous to touch overhead electric lines. You
  <strong>MUST</strong> obey the safe height warning road signs and you
  should not continue forward onto the railway if your vehicle touches
  any height barrier or bells. The clearance available is usually 5
  metres (16 feet 6 inches) but may be lower.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36, TSRGD 2002 reg 17(5)</strong></p>

<h2>293</h2>

<p><strong>Controlled Crossings.</strong> Most crossings have traffic
  light signals with a steady amber light, twin flashing red stop
  lights (see &#8216;Light signals controlling traffic&#8217; and
  &#8216;Traffic signs&#8217;) and an audible alarm for pedestrians.
  They may have full, half or no barriers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You MUST always obey the flashing red stop lights.</li>

  <li>You MUST stop behind the white line across the road.</li>

  <li>Keep going if you have already crossed the white line when the
    amber light comes on.</li>

  <li>Do not reverse onto or over a controlled crossing.</li>

  <li>You MUST wait if a train goes by and the red lights continue to
    flash. This means another train will be passing soon.</li>

  <li>Only cross when the lights go off and barriers open.</li>

  <li>Never zig-zag around half-barriers, they lower automatically
    because a train is approaching.</li>

  <li>At crossings where there are no barriers, a train is approaching
    when the lights show.</li>
</ul>

<h2>294</h2>

<p><strong>Railway telephones.</strong> If you are driving a large or
  slow- moving vehicle, a long, low vehicle with a risk of grounding,
  or herding animals, a train could arrive before you are clear of the
  crossing. You <strong>MUST</strong> obey any sign instructing you to
  use the railway telephone to obtain permission to cross. You
  <strong>MUST</strong> also telephone when clear of the crossing if
  requested to do so.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10 &amp;
  16(1)</strong></p>

<h2>295</h2>

<p><strong>Crossings without traffic lights.</strong> Vehicles should
  stop and wait at the barrier or gate when it begins to close and not
  cross until the barrier or gate opens.</p>

<h2>296</h2>

<p><strong>User-operated gates or barriers.</strong> Some crossings
  have &#8216;Stop&#8217; signs and small red and green lights. You
  <strong>MUST NOT</strong> cross when the red light is showing, only
  cross if the green light is on. If crossing with a vehicle, you
  should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>open the gates or barriers on both sides of the crossing</li>

  <li>check that the green light is still on and cross quickly</li>

  <li>close the gates or barriers when you are clear of the crossing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10 &amp;
  52(2)</strong></p>

<h2>297</h2>

<p>If there are no lights, follow the procedure in Rule 295. Stop, look
  both ways and listen before you cross. If there is a railway
  telephone, always use it to contact the signal operator to make sure
  it is safe to cross. Inform the signal operator again when you are
  clear of the crossing.</p>

<h2>298</h2>

<p><strong>Open crossings.</strong> These have no gates, barriers,
  attendant or traffic lights but will have a &#8216;Give Way&#8217;
  sign. You should look both ways, listen and make sure there is no
  train coming before you cross.</p>

<h2>299</h2>

<p><strong>Incidents and breakdowns.</strong> If your vehicle breaks
  down, or if you have an incident on a crossing you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get everyone out of the vehicle and clear of the crossing
    immediately</li>

  <li>use a railway telephone if available to tell the signal operator.
    Follow the instructions you are given</li>

  <li>move the vehicle clear of the crossing if there is time before a
    train arrives. If the alarm sounds, or the amber light comes on,
    leave the vehicle and get clear of the crossing immediately.</li>
</ul>
