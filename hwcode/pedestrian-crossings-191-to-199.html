<h1>5. Pedestrian crossings (191 to 199)</h1>
</header>
<h2>191</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> park on a crossing or in the area
  covered by the zig-zag lines. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> overtake
  the moving vehicle nearest the crossing or the vehicle nearest the
  crossing which has stopped to give way to pedestrians.<br>
  <strong>Laws ZPPPCRGD regs 18, 20 &amp; 24, RTRA sect 25(5) &amp;
  TSRGD regs 10, 27 &amp; 28</strong></p>

<h2>192</h2>

<p>In queuing traffic, you should keep the crossing clear.</p>

<h2>193</h2>

<p>You should take extra care where the view of either side of the
  crossing is blocked by queuing traffic or incorrectly parked
  vehicles. Pedestrians may be crossing between stationary vehicles.</p>

<h2>194</h2>

<p>Allow pedestrians plenty of time to cross and do not harass them by
  revving your engine or edging forward.</p>

<h2>195</h2>

<p><strong>Zebra crossings.</strong> As you approach a zebra crossing</p>

<ul>
  <li>look out for pedestrians waiting to cross and be ready to slow
    down or stop to let them cross</li>

  <li>you MUST give way when a pedestrian has moved onto a crossing</li>

  <li>allow more time for stopping on wet or icy roads</li>

  <li>do not wave or use your horn to invite pedestrians across; this
    could be dangerous if another vehicle is approaching</li>

  <li>be aware of pedestrians approaching from the side of the
    crossing.</li>
</ul>

<p>A zebra crossing with a central island is two separate crossings
  (see pictures in Crossings (18 to 30).<br>
  <strong>Law ZPPPCRGD reg 25</strong></p>

<h2>Signal-controlled crossings</h2>

<h2>196</h2>

<p><strong>Pelican crossings.</strong> These are signal-controlled
  crossings where flashing amber follows the red &#8216;Stop&#8217;
  light. You <strong>MUST</strong> stop when the red light shows. When
  the amber light is flashing, you <strong>MUST</strong> give way to
  any pedestrians on the crossing. If the amber light is flashing and
  there are no pedestrians on the crossing, you may proceed with
  caution.<br>
  <strong>Laws ZPPPCRGD regs 23 &amp; 26 &amp; RTRA sect 25(5)</strong></p>

<p><img alt="Highway Code - Rule 196 Allow Pedestrians To Cross When The Amber Light Is Flashing" src="hc_rule_196_allow_pedestrians_to_cross_when_the_amber_light_is_flashing.jpg" width="100%"></p>

<h2>197</h2>

<p>Pelican crossings which go straight across the road are one
  crossing, even when there is a central island. You
  <strong>MUST</strong> wait for pedestrians who are crossing from the
  other side of the island.<br>
  <strong>Laws ZPPPCRGD reg 26 &amp; RTRA sect 25(5)</strong></p>

<h2>198</h2>

<p>Give way to anyone still crossing after the signal for vehicles has
  changed to green. This advice applies to all crossings.</p>

<h2>199</h2>

<p><strong>Toucan, puffin and equestrian crossings.</strong> These are
  similar to pelican crossings, but there is no flashing amber phase;
  the light sequence for traffic at these three crossings is the same
  as at traffic lights. If the signal-controlled crossing is not
  working, proceed with extreme caution.</p>
