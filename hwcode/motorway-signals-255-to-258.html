<h1>2. Motorway signals (255 to 258)</h1>
</header>
<h2>255</h2>

<p>Motorway signals (see &#8216;Light signals controlling
  traffic&#8217;) are used to warn you of a danger ahead. For example,
  there may be an incident, fog, a spillage or road workers on the
  carriageway which you may not immediately be able to see.</p>

<h2>256</h2>

<p>Signals situated on the central reservation apply to all lanes. On
  very busy stretches, signals may be overhead with a separate signal
  for each lane.</p>

<h2>257</h2>

<p><strong>Amber flashing lights.</strong> These warn of a hazard
  ahead. The signal may show a temporary maximum speed limit, lanes
  that are closed or a message such as &#8216;Fog&#8217;. Adjust your
  speed and look out for the danger until you pass a signal which is
  not flashing or one that gives the &#8216;All clear&#8217; sign and
  you are sure it is safe to increase your speed.</p>

<h2>258</h2>

<p>Red flashing lights. If red lights on the overhead signals flash
  above your lane and a red &#8216;X&#8217; is showing, you
  <strong>MUST NOT</strong> go beyond the signal in that lane. If red
  lights flash on a signal in the central reservation or at the side of
  the road, you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> go beyond the signal in any
  lane.<br>
