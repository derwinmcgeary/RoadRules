<h1>4. New drivers</h1>
</header>
<p>Special rules as set out below apply for a period of two years from
  the date of passing their first driving test, to drivers and
  motorcyclists from</p>

<ul>
  <li>the UK, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>, the Isle of Man, the
    Channel Islands or Gibraltar who passed their first driving test in
    any of those countries</li>

  <li>other foreign countries who have to pass a UK driving test to
    gain a UK licence, in which case the UK driving test is treated as
    their first driving test; and</li>

  <li>other foreign countries who (without needing a test) exchanged
    their licence for a UK licence and subsequently passed a UK driving
    test to drive another type of vehicle, in which case the UK driving
    test is treated as their first driving test. For example a driver
    who exchanges a foreign licence (car) for a UK licence (car) and
    who later passes a test to drive another type of vehicle (e.g. an
    <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr>) will be subject to
    the special rules.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a person subject to the special rules accumulates 6 or more
  penalty points before the end of the 2-year period (including any
  points acquired before passing the test) their licence will be
  revoked automatically. To regain the licence they must reapply for a
  provisional licence and may drive only as a learner until they pass a
  further driving test (also see Annex 8 &#8211; Safety code for new
  drivers. <br>
  <strong>Law RT(ND)A</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note.</strong> This applies even if they pay for offences by
  fixed penalty. Drivers in the first group (UK, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> etc.) who already have a
  full licence for one type of vehicle are not affected by the special
  rules if they later pass a test to drive another type of vehicle.</p>
