<h1>3. Crossings (18 to 30)</h1>
</header>
<h2>18</h2>

<p><strong>At all crossings.</strong> When using any type of crossing
  you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>always check that the traffic has stopped before you start to
    cross or push a pram onto a crossing</li>

  <li>always cross between the studs or over the zebra markings. Do not
    cross at the side of the crossing or on the zig-zag lines, as it
    can be dangerous.</li>
</ul>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> loiter on any type of crossing.<br>
  <strong>Laws ZPPPCRGD reg 19 &amp; RTRA sect 25(5)</strong></p>

<h2>19</h2>

<p><strong>Zebra crossings.</strong> Give traffic plenty of time to see
  you and to stop before you start to cross. Vehicles will need more
  time when the road is slippery. Wait until traffic has stopped from
  both directions or the road is clear before crossing. Remember that
  traffic does not have to stop until someone has moved onto the
  crossing. Keep looking both ways, and listening, in case a driver or
  rider has not seen you and attempts to overtake a vehicle that has
  stopped.</p>

<h2>20</h2>

<p>Where there is an island in the middle of a zebra crossing, wait on
  the island and follow Rule 19 before you cross the second half of the
  road &#8211; it is a separate crossing.</p>

<h2>21</h2>

<p><strong>At traffic lights.</strong> There may be special signals for
  pedestrians. You should only start to cross the road when the green
  figure shows. If you have started to cross the road and the green
  figure goes out, you should still have time to reach the other side,
  but do not delay. If no pedestrian signals have been provided, watch
  carefully and do not cross until the traffic lights are red and the
  traffic has stopped. Keep looking and check for traffic that may be
  turning the corner. Remember that traffic lights may let traffic move
  in some lanes while traffic in other lanes has stopped.</p>

<h2>22</h2>

<p><strong>Pelican crossings.</strong> These are signal-controlled
  crossings operated by pedestrians. Push the control button to
  activate the traffic signals. When the red figure shows, do not
  cross. When a steady green figure shows, check the traffic has
  stopped then cross with care. When the green figure begins to flash
  you should not start to cross. If you have already started you should
  have time to finish crossing safely.</p>

<h2>23</h2>

<p><strong>Puffin crossings</strong> differ from pelican crossings as
  the red and green figures are above the control box on your side of
  the road and there is no flashing green figure phase. Press the
  button and wait for the green figure to show.</p>

<h3>24</h3>

<p>When the road is congested, traffic on your side of the road may be
  forced to stop even though their lights are green. Traffic may still
  be moving on the other side of the road, so press the button and wait
  for the signal to cross.</p>

<h2>25</h2>

<p><strong>Toucan crossings</strong> are light-controlled crossings
  which allow cyclists and pedestrians to share crossing space and
  cross at the same time. They are push-button operated. Pedestrians
  and cyclists will see the green signal together. Cyclists are
  permitted to ride across.</p>

<h2>26</h2>

<p>At some crossings there is a bleeping sound or voice signal to
  indicate to blind or partially sighted people when the steady green
  figure is showing, and there may be a tactile signal to help
  deafblind people.</p>

<h2>27</h2>

<p><strong>Equestrian crossings</strong> are for horse riders. They
  have pavement barriers, wider crossing spaces, horse and rider
  figures in the light panels and either two sets of controls (one
  higher), or just one higher control panel.</p>

<p>There is often a parallel crossing.</p>

<h2>28</h2>

<p><strong>&#8216;Staggered&#8217; pelican or puffin
  crossings.</strong> When the crossings on each side of the central
  refuge are not in line they are two separate crossings. On reaching
  the central island, press the button again and wait for a steady
  green figure.</p>

  middle) are two separate crossings<img alt="Highway Code - Rule 28 Staggered Crossings With An Island In The Middle" src="hc_rule_28_staggered_crossings_with_an_island_in_the_middle.jpg" width="100%"></p>

<h2>29</h2>

<p><strong>Crossings controlled by an authorised person.</strong> Do
  not cross the road unless you are signalled to do so by a police
  officer, traffic warden or school crossing patrol. Always cross in
  front of them.</p>

<h2>30</h2>

<p>Where there are no controlled crossing points available it is
  advisable to cross where there is an island in the middle of the
  road. Use the Green Cross Code (see Rule 7) to cross to the island
  and then stop and use it again to cross the second half of the road.</p>
