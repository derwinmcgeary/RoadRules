<h1>5. Other consequences of offending</h1>
</header>
<p>Where an offence is punishable by imprisonment then the vehicle used
  to commit the offence may be confiscated.<br>
  <strong>Law PCC(S)A, sect 143</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the penalties a court may decide to impose, the cost
  of insurance is likely to rise considerably following conviction for
  a serious driving offence. This is because insurance companies
  consider such drivers are more likely to be involved in a collision.</p>

<p>Drivers disqualified for drinking and driving twice within 10 years,
  or once if they are over 2 and a half times the legal limit, or those
  who refused to give a specimen, also have to satisfy the Driver and
  Vehicle Licensing Agency&#8217;s Medical Branch that they do not have
  an alcohol problem and are otherwise fit to drive before their
  licence is returned at the end of their period of disqualification.
  Persistent misuse of drugs or alcohol may lead to the withdrawal of a
  driving licence.</p>
