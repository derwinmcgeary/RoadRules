<h1>8. Leaving the motorway (272 to 273)</h1>
</header>
<h2>272</h2>

<p>Unless signs indicate that a lane leads directly off the motorway,
  you will normally leave the motorway by a slip road on your left. You
  should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>watch for the signs letting you know you are getting near your
    exit</li>

  <li>move into the left-hand lane well before reaching your exit</li>

  <li>signal left in good time and reduce your speed on the slip road
    as necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>273</h2>

<p>On leaving the motorway or using a link road between motorways, your
  speed may be higher than you realise - 50 mph may feel like 30 mph.
  Check your speedometer and adjust your speed accordingly. Some
  slip-roads and link roads have sharp bends, so you will need to slow
  down.</p>
