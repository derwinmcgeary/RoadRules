<h1>6. Overtaking (267 to 269)</h1>
</header>
<h2>267</h2>

<p>Do not overtake unless you are sure it is safe and legal to do so.
  Overtake only on the right. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check your mirrors</li>

  <li>take time to judge the speeds correctly</li>

  <li>make sure that the lane you will be joining is sufficiently clear
    ahead and behind</li>

  <li>take a quick sideways glance into the blind spot area to verify
    the position of a vehicle that may have disappeared from your view
    in the mirror</li>

  <li>remember that traffic may be coming up behind you very quickly.
    Check all your mirrors carefully. Look out for motorcyclists. When
    it is safe to do so, signal in plenty of time, then move out</li>

  <li>ensure you do not cut in on the vehicle you have overtaken</li>

  <li>be especially careful at night and in poor visibility when it is
    harder to judge speed and distance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>268</h2>

<p>Do not overtake on the left or move to a lane on your left to
  overtake. In congested conditions, where adjacent lanes of traffic
  are moving at similar speeds, traffic in left-hand lanes may
  sometimes be moving faster than traffic to the right. In these
  conditions you may keep up with the traffic in your lane even if this
  means passing traffic in the lane to your right. Do not weave in and
  out of lanes to overtake.</p>

<h2>269</h2>

<p><strong>Hard shoulder.</strong> You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use
  the hard shoulder for overtaking. In areas where an Active Traffic
  Management (ATM) Scheme is in force, the hard shoulder may be used as
  a running lane. You will know when you can use this because a speed
  limit sign will be shown above all open lanes, including the hard
  shoulder. A red cross or blank sign above the hard shoulder means
  that you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive on the hard shoulder except
  in an emergency or breakdown. Emergency refuge areas have also been
  built into these areas for use in cases of emergency or
  breakdown.<br>
