<h1>3. Icy and snowy weather (228 to 231)</h1>
</header>
<h2>228</h2>

<p>In winter check the local weather forecast for warnings of icy or
  snowy weather. <strong>DO NOT</strong> drive in these conditions
  unless your journey is essential. If it is, take great care and allow
  more time for your journey. Take an emergency kit of de-icer and ice
  scraper, torch, warm clothing and boots, first aid kit, jump leads
  and a shovel, together with a warm drink and emergency food in case
  you get stuck or your vehicle breaks down.</p>

<p>Before you set off</p>

<ul>
  <li>you <strong>MUST</strong> be able to see, so clear all snow and
    ice from all your windows</li>

  <li>you <strong>MUST</strong> ensure that lights are clean and number
    plates are clearly visible and legible</li>

  <li>make sure the mirrors are clear and the windows are demisted
    thoroughly</li>

  <li>remove all snow that might fall off into the path of other road
    users</li>

  <li>check your planned route is clear of delays and that no further
    snowfalls or severe weather are predicted.<br>

<h2>230</h2>

<p><strong>When driving</strong> in icy or snowy weather</p>

<ul>
  <li>drive with care, even if the roads have been treated</li>

  <li>keep well back from the road user in front as stopping distances
    can be ten times greater than on dry roads</li>

  <li>take care when overtaking vehicles spreading salt or other
    de-icer, particularly if you are riding a motorcycle or cycle</li>

  <li>watch out for snowploughs which may throw out snow on either
    side. Do not overtake them unless the lane you intend to use has
    been cleared</li>

  <li>be prepared for the road conditions to change over relatively
    short distances</li>

  <li>listen to travel bulletins and take note of variable message
    signs that may provide information about weather, road and traffic
    conditions ahead.</li>
</ul>

<h2>231</h2>

<p><strong>Drive extremely carefully</strong> when the roads are icy.
  Avoid sudden actions as these could cause loss of control. You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>drive at a slow speed in as high a gear as possible; accelerate
    and brake very gently</li>

  <li>drive particularly slowly on bends where loss of control is more
    likely. Brake progressively on the straight before you reach a
    bend. Having slowed down, steer smoothly round the bend, avoiding
    sudden actions</li>

  <li>check your grip on the road surface when there is snow or ice by
    choosing a safe place to brake gently. If the steering feels
    unresponsive this may indicate ice and your vehicle losing its grip
    on the road. When travelling on ice, tyres make virtually no noise.</li>
