<h1>5. Other vehicles (219 to 225)</h1>
</header>
<h2>219</h2>

<p><strong>Emergency and incident support vehicles.</strong> You should
  look and listen for ambulances, fire engines, police, doctors or
  other emergency vehicles using flashing blue, red or green lights and
  sirens or flashing headlights, or traffic officer and incident
  support vehicles using flashing amber lights. When one approaches do
  not panic. Consider the route of such a vehicle and take appropriate
  action to let it pass, while complying with all traffic signs. If
  necessary, pull to the side of the road and stop, but try to avoid
  stopping before the brow of a hill, a bend or narrow section of road.
  Do not endanger yourself, other road users or pedestrians and avoid
  mounting the kerb. Do not brake harshly on approach to a junction or
  roundabout, as a following vehicle may not have the same view as you.</p>

<h2>220</h2>

<p><strong>Powered vehicles used by disabled people.</strong> These
  small vehicles travel at a maximum speed of 8 mph (12 km/h). On a
  dual carriageway where the speed limit exceeds 50 mph (80 km/h) they
  <strong>MUST</strong> have a flashing amber beacon, but on other
  roads you may not have that advance warning (see Rules 36 to 46
  inclusive).</p>

<p><strong>Law RVLR reg 17(1) &amp; 26</strong></p>

<h2>221</h2>

<p><strong>Large vehicles.</strong> These may need extra road space to
  turn or to deal with a hazard that you are not able to see. If you
  are following a large vehicle, such as a bus or articulated lorry, be
  aware that the driver may not be able to see you in the mirrors. Be
  prepared to stop and wait if it needs room or time to turn.</p>

<h2>222</h2>

<p>Large vehicles can block your view. Your ability to see and to plan
  ahead will be improved if you pull back to increase your separation
  distance. Be patient, as larger vehicles are subject to lower speed
  limits than cars and motorcycles. Many large vehicles may be fitted
  with speed limiting devices which will restrict speed to 56 mph (90
  km/h) even on a motorway.</p>

<h2>223</h2>

<p><strong>Buses, coaches and trams.</strong> Give priority to these
  vehicles when you can do so safely, especially when they signal to
  pull away from stops. Look out for people getting off a bus or tram
  and crossing the road.</p>

<h2>224</h2>

<p><strong>Electric vehicles.</strong> Be careful of electric vehicles
  such as milk floats and trams. Trams move quickly but silently and
  cannot steer to avoid you.</p>

<h2>225</h2>

<p><strong>Vehicles with flashing amber beacons.</strong> These warn of
  a slow-moving or stationary vehicle (such as a traffic officer
  vehicle, salt spreader, snow plough or recovery vehicle) or abnormal
  loads, so approach with caution. On unrestricted dual carriageways,
  motor vehicles first used on or after 1 January 1947 with a maximum
  speed of 25 mph (40 km/h) or less (such as tractors)
  <strong>MUST</strong> use a flashing amber beacon (also see Rule 220
  above). <strong>Law RVLR 1989, reg 17</strong></p>
