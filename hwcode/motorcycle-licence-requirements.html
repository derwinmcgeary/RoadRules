<h1>2. Motorcycle licence requirements</h1>
</header>
<p>If you have a provisional motorcycle licence, you
  <strong>MUST</strong> satisfactorily complete a Compulsory Basic
  Training (CBT) course.</p>

<p>You can then ride unaccompanied on the public road a motorcycle up
  to 125 cc, with a power output not exceeding 11 kW, with L plates (in
  Wales either D plates or L plates, or both, can be used), for up to
  two years.</p>

<p>To ride a moped, learners <strong>MUST</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be 16 or over</li>

  <li>have a provisional moped licence</li>

  <li>complete CBT training.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can then ride unaccompanied on the public road a two-wheeled
  vehicle with a maximum design speed of 45 km/h (28 mph), with L
  plates (in Wales either D plates or L plates, or both, can be used),
  for up to two years.</p>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> first pass the theory test for motorcycles
  and then the moped practical test to obtain your full moped licence.</p>

<p>If you passed your car driving test before 1 February 2001 you are
  qualified to ride a moped without L plates (and/or D plates in
  Wales), although it is recommended that you complete CBT before
  riding on the road. If you passed your car driving test after this
  date you <strong>MUST</strong> complete CBT before riding a moped on
  the road.</p>

<h2>Licence categories for mopeds and motorcycles</h2>

<p><strong>Category AM (moped) &#8211; minimum age 16</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>two-wheeled vehicle with a maximum design speed of 45 km/h (28
    mph)</li>

  <li>three- or four-wheeled vehicle with a maximum design speed over
    25 km/h (15.5 mph), up to 50 cc and with a power output not
    exceeding 4 kW.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Category A1 &#8211; minimum age 17</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>motorcycles up to 125 cc, with a power output not exceeding 11 kW</li>

  <li>tricycles with a power output not exceeding 15 kW.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Category A2 &#8211; minimum age 19</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>motorcycles with a power output not exceeding 35 kW.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Category A</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>unrestricted motorcycles with a power output over 35 kW (minimum
    age 24 under direct access, or 21 under progressive access)</li>

  <li>tricycles with a power output over 15 kW (minimum age 21).</li>
</ul>

<p>Progressive access is a process that allows a rider to take a
  higher-category practical test if they already have at least two
  years&#8217; experience on a lower-category motorcycle. For example,
  if you have held a category A2 licence for a minimum of two years,
  you can take the category A practical test at age 21. There is no
  requirement to take another theory test.</p>

<p>If you want to learn to ride motorcycles larger than 125 cc and with
  a power output over 11 kW, you <strong>MUST</strong> meet the minimum
  age requirements, satisfactorily complete a CBT course and be
  accompanied by an approved instructor on another motorcycle in radio
  contact.</p>

<p>To obtain your full moped or motorcycle licence you
  <strong>MUST</strong> pass a motorcycle theory test and modules 1 and
  2 practical tests on a two-wheeled motorcycle.</p>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> carry a pillion passenger or pull a
  trailer until you have passed your test. Also see Rule 253 covering
  vehicles prohibited from motorways.<br>
