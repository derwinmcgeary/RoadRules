<h1>2. Vehicle security</h1>
</header>
<p>When you leave your vehicle you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>remove the ignition key and engage the steering lock</li>

  <li>lock the car, even if you only leave it for a few minutes</li>

  <li>close the windows completely</li>

  <li>never leave children or pets in an unventilated car</li>

  <li>take all contents with you, or lock them in the boot. Remember,
    for all a thief knows a carrier bag may contain valuables</li>

  <li>never leave vehicle documents in the car.</li>
</ul>

<p>For extra security fit an anti-theft device such as an alarm or
  immobiliser. If you are buying a new car it is a good idea to check
  the level of built-in security features. Consider having your
  registration number etched on all your car windows. This is a cheap
  and effective deterrent to professional thieves.</p>
