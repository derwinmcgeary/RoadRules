</header>
<h2>47</h2>

<p>Horse-drawn vehicles used on the highway should be operated and
  maintained in accordance with standards set out in the Department for
  Transport&#8217;s Code of Practice for Horse-Drawn Vehicles. This
  Code lays down the requirements for a road driving assessment and
  includes a comprehensive list of safety checks to ensure that a
  carriage and its fittings are safe and in good working order. The
  standards set out in the Road Driving Assessment may be required to
  be met by a Local Authority if an operator wishes to obtain a local
  authority licence to operate a passenger-carrying service.</p>

<h2>48</h2>

<p><strong>Safety equipment and clothing.</strong> All horse-drawn
  vehicles should have two red rear reflectors. It is safer not to
  drive at night but if you do, a light showing white to the front and
  red to the rear <strong>MUST</strong> be fitted. <br>
