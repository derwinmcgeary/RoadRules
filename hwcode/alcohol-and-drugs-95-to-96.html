<h1>3. Alcohol and drugs (95 to 96)</h1>
</header>
<h2>95</h2>

<p><strong>Do not drink and drive</strong> as it will seriously affect
  your judgement and abilities.</p>

<p>In England and Wales you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive with a
  breath alcohol level higher than 35 microgrammes/100 millilitres of
  breath or a blood alcohol level of more than 80 milligrammes/100
  millilitres of blood.</p>

<p>In Scotland the legal limits are lower. You <strong>MUST
  NOT</strong> drive with a breath alcohol level higher than 22
  microgrammes/100 millilitres of breath or a blood alcohol level of
  more than 50 milligrammes/100 millilitres of blood.</p>

<p>Alcohol will</p>

<ul>
  <li>give a false sense of confidence</li>

  <li>reduce co-ordination and slow down reactions</li>

  <li>affect judgement of speed, distance and risk</li>

  <li>reduce your driving ability, even if you&#8217;re below the legal
    limit</li>

  <li>take time to leave your body; you may be unfit to drive in the
    evening after drinking at lunchtime, or in the morning after
    drinking the previous evening</li>
</ul>

<p>The best solution is not to drink at all when planning to drive
  because any amount of alcohol affects your ability to drive safely.
  If you are going to drink, arrange another means of transport.<br>

<h2>96</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive under the influence of drugs or
  medicine. For medicines, check with your doctor or pharmacist and do
  not drive if you are advised that you may be impaired.</p>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive if you have illegal drugs or
  certain medicines in your blood above specified limits. It is highly
  dangerous so never take illegal drugs if you intend to drive; the
  effects are unpredictable, but can be even more severe than alcohol
  and result in fatal or serious road crashes. Illegal drugs have been
  specified at very low levels so even small amounts of use could be
  above the specified limits. The limits for certain medicines have
  been specified at higher levels, above the levels generally found in
  the blood of patients who have taken normal therapeutic doses. If you
  are found to have a concentration of a drug above its specified limit
  in your blood because you have been prescribed or legitimately
  supplied a particularly high dose of medicine, then you can raise a
  statutory medical defence, provided your driving was not impaired by
  the medicine you are taking.<br>
