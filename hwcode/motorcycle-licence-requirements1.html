<h1>7. Motorcycle licence requirements</h1>
</header>
<p>If you have a provisional motorcycle licence, you
  <strong>MUST</strong> satisfactorily complete a Compulsory Basic
  Training (<abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr>) course.
  You can then ride a motorcycle up to 125 cc with a power output not
  exceeding 11 kW on the public road, with L plates (in Wales either D
  plates, L plates or both can be used), for up to two years. Under
  direct access you can practise on a motorcycle that exceeds 125 cc
  provided that</p>

<ul>
  <li>you meet the minimum age for the category concerned</li>

  <li>you&#8217;re accompanied at all times by a qualified approved
    trainer, who is on another motorcycle and in radio contact with you</li>

  <li>fluorescent or reflective safety clothing is worn during
    supervision</li>

  <li>red L plates (D plates in Wales) are fitted and provisional
    licence restrictions followed.</li>
</ul>

<p>To obtain your full motorcycle licence you MUST pass a motorcycle
  theory test and then a practical test.<br>
  <strong>Law MV(DL)R regs 16 &amp; 68</strong></p>

<p><strong>A1 motorcycle licence:</strong> At age 17 or over, you take
  a test on a motorcycle without sidecar of between 120 and 125 cc. If
  you pass you may ride a motorcycle up to 125 cc with power output up
  to 11 kW, or a motor tricycle with power not exceeding 15 kW.</p>

<p><strong>A2 motorcycle licence:</strong> At age 19 or over, you take
  a test on a motorcycle without sidecar of at least 395 cc with a
  power output of at least 25 kW but not exceeding 35 kW. If you pass,
  you may ride any motorcycle not exceeding 35 kW and with a power to
  weight ratio not exceeding 0.2 kW/kg.</p>

<p><strong>Full A motorcycle licence:</strong> Test taken on a
  motorcycle without sidecar, of at least 595 cc and an engine power of
  at least 40 kW This gives you full access to all motorcycles and
  motor tricycles. You obtain a category A licence by taking
  progressive access from age 21, or under the direct access scheme
  from age 24.</p>

<p><strong>Category A under progressive access:</strong> You can take a
  category A practical test at age 21 if you already have an A2 licence
  that you&#8217;ve held for a minimum of two years. You don&#8217;t
  need to take another theory test or hold a <abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr> certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Category A under direct access:</strong> This is for riders
  aged 24 or over. To obtain a category A licence you must</p>

<ul>
  <li>successfully complete a <abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr> course</li>

  <li>pass the motorcycle theory test</li>

  <li>pass the practical motorcycle test.</li>
</ul>

<p>Passing the practical test on a motorcycle of at least 40 kW
  (53.6bhp) gives immediate access to all sizes of motorcycle.</p>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> carry a pillion passenger or pull a
  trailer until you have passed your test. Also see Rule 253 covering
  vehicles prohibited from motorways.<br>
  <strong>Law MV(DL)R reg 16</strong></p>

<h2>Moped licence requirements</h2>

<p>A moped <strong>MUST</strong> have an engine capacity not exceeding
  50 cc, not weigh more than 250kg and be designed to have a maximum
  speed not exceeding 28mph (45 km/h). Before June 2003 a licence
  allowed the riding of mopeds up to 50km/h.</p>

<p>To ride a moped, learners <strong>MUST</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>be 16 or over</li>

  <li>have a provisional moped licence</li>

  <li>complete <abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr>
    training.</li>
</ul>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> first pass the theory test for motorcycles
  and then the moped practical test to obtain your full moped licence.
  If you passed your car driving test before 1 February 2001 you are
  qualified to ride a moped without L plates (and/or D plates in
  Wales), although it is recommended that you complete <abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr> before riding on the
  road. If you passed your car driving test after this date you
  <strong>MUST</strong> complete <abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr> before riding a moped on
  the road.<br>
