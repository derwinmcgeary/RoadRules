<p><strong>Dogs.</strong> Do not let a dog out on the road on its own.
  Keep it on a short lead when walking on the pavement, road or path
  shared with cyclists or horse riders.</p>

<h2>57</h2>

<p>When in a vehicle make sure dogs or other animals are suitably
  restrained so they cannot distract you while you are driving or
  injure you, or themselves, if you stop quickly. A seat belt harness,
  pet carrier, dog cage or dog guard are ways of restraining animals in
  cars.</p>

<h2>58</h2>

<p><strong>Animals being herded.</strong> These should be kept under
  control at all times. You should, if possible, send another person
  along the road in front to warn other road users, especially at a
  bend or the brow of a hill. It is safer not to move animals after
  dark, but if you do, then wear reflective clothing and ensure that
  lights are carried (white at the front and red at the rear of the
  herd).</p>
