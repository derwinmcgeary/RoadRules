<h1>4. Windy weather (232 to 233)</h1>
</header>
<h2>232</h2>

<p>High-sided vehicles are most affected by windy weather, but strong
  gusts can also blow a car, cyclist, motorcyclist or horse rider off
  course. This can happen on open stretches of road exposed to strong
  crosswinds, or when passing bridges or gaps in hedges.</p>

<h2>233</h2>

<p>In very windy weather your vehicle may be affected by turbulence
  created by large vehicles. Motorcyclists are particularly affected,
  so keep well back from them when they are overtaking a high-sided
  vehicle.</p>
