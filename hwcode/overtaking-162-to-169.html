<h1>2. Overtaking (162 to 169)</h1>
</header>
<h2>162</h2>

<p><strong>Before overtaking</strong> you should make sure</p>

<ul>
  <li>the road is sufficiently clear ahead</li>

  <li>road users are not beginning to overtake you</li>

  <li>there is a suitable gap in front of the road user you plan to
    overtake.</li>
</ul>

<h2>163</h2>

<p><strong>Overtake only</strong> when it is safe and legal to do so.
  You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>not get too close to the vehicle you intend to overtake</li>

  <li>use your mirrors, signal when it is safe to do so, take a quick
    sideways glance if necessary into the blind spot area and then
    start to move out</li>

  <li>not assume that you can simply follow a vehicle ahead which is
    overtaking; there may only be enough room for one vehicle</li>

  <li>move quickly past the vehicle you are overtaking, once you have
    started to overtake. Allow plenty of room. Move back to the left as
    soon as you can but do not cut in</li>

  <li>take extra care at night and in poor visibility when it is harder
    to judge speed and distance</li>

  <li>give way to oncoming vehicles before passing parked vehicles or
    other obstructions on your side of the road</li>

  <li>only overtake on the left if the vehicle in front is signalling
    to turn right, and there is room to do so</li>

  <li>stay in your lane if traffic is moving slowly in queues. If the
    queue on your right is moving more slowly than you are, you may
    pass on the left</li>

  <li>give motorcyclists, cyclists and horse riders at least as much
    room as you would when overtaking a car (see Rules 211 to 213) and
    214 to 215).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Remember: Mirrors &#8211; Signal &#8211; Manoeuvre</strong></p>

<h2>164</h2>

<p><strong>Large vehicles.</strong> Overtaking these is more difficult.
  You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>drop back. This will increase your ability to see ahead and
    should allow the driver of the large vehicle to see you in their
    mirrors. Getting too close to large vehicles, including
    agricultural vehicles such as a tractor with a trailer or other
    fixed equipment, will obscure your view of the road ahead and there
    may be another slow-moving vehicle in front</li>

  <li>make sure that you have enough room to complete your overtaking
    manoeuvre before committing yourself. It takes longer to pass a
    large vehicle. If in doubt do not overtake</li>

  <li>not assume you can follow a vehicle ahead which is overtaking a
    long vehicle. If a problem develops, they may abort overtaking and
    pull back in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>165</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> overtake</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you would have to cross or straddle double white lines with a
    solid line nearest to you (but see Rule 129)</li>

  <li>if you would have to enter an area designed to divide traffic, if
    it is surrounded by a solid white line</li>

  <li>the nearest vehicle to a pedestrian crossing, especially when it
    has stopped to let pedestrians cross</li>

  <li>if you would have to enter a lane reserved for buses, trams or
    cycles during its hours of operation</li>

  <li>after a &#8216;No Overtaking&#8217; sign and until you pass a
    sign cancelling the restriction.<br>
    <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36, TSRGD regs 10, 22, 23 &amp; 24,
    ZPPPCRGD reg 24</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>166</h2>

<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> overtake if there is any doubt, or where you
  cannot see far enough ahead to be sure it is safe. For example, when
  you are approaching</p>

<ul>
  <li>a corner or bend</li>

  <li>a hump bridge</li>

  <li>the brow of a hill.</li>
</ul>

<h2>167</h2>

<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> overtake where you might come into conflict
  with other road users. For example</p>

<ul>
  <li>approaching or at a road junction on either side of the road</li>

  <li>where the road narrows</li>

  <li>when approaching a school crossing patrol</li>

  <li>between the kerb and a bus or tram when it is at a stop</li>

  <li>where traffic is queuing at junctions or road works</li>

  <li>when you would force another road user to swerve or slow down</li>

  <li>at a level crossing</li>

  <li>when a road user is indicating right, even if you believe the
    signal should have been cancelled. Do not take a risk; wait for the
    signal to be cancelled</li>

  <li>stay behind if you are following a cyclist approaching a
    roundabout or junction, and you intend to turn left</li>

  <li>when a tram is standing at a kerbside tram stop and there is no
    clearly marked passing lane for other traffic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>168</h2>

<p><strong>Being overtaken.</strong> If a driver is trying to overtake
  you, maintain a steady course and speed, slowing down if necessary to
  let the vehicle pass. Never obstruct drivers who wish to pass.
  Speeding up or driving unpredictably while someone is overtaking you
  is dangerous. Drop back to maintain a two-second gap if someone
  overtakes and pulls into the gap in front of you.</p>

<h2>169</h2>

<p>Do not hold up a long queue of traffic, especially if you are
  driving a large or slow-moving vehicle. Check your mirrors
  frequently, and if necessary, pull in where it is safe and let
  traffic pass.</p>
