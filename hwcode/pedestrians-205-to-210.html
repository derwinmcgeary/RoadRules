<h1>2. Pedestrians (205 to 210)</h1>
</header>
<h2>205</h2>

<p>There is a risk of pedestrians, especially children, stepping
  unexpectedly into the road. You should drive with the safety of
  children in mind at a speed suitable for the conditions.</p>

<h2>206</h2>

<p><strong>Drive carefully and slowly</strong> when</p>

<ul>
  <li>in crowded shopping streets, Home Zones and Quiet Lanes (see Rule
    218) or residential areas</li>

  <li>driving past bus and tram stops; pedestrians may emerge suddenly
    into the road</li>

  <li>passing parked vehicles, especially ice cream vans; children are
    more interested in ice cream than traffic and may run into the road
    unexpectedly</li>

  <li>needing to cross a pavement or cycle track; for example, to reach
    or leave a driveway. Give way to pedestrians and cyclists on the
    pavement</li>

  <li>reversing into a side road; look all around the vehicle and give
    way to any pedestrians who may be crossing the road</li>

  <li>turning at road junctions; give way to pedestrians who are
    already crossing the road into which you are turning</li>

  <li>the pavement is closed due to street repairs and pedestrians are
    directed to use the road</li>

  <li>approaching pedestrians on narrow rural roads without a footway
    or footpath. Always slow down and be prepared to stop if necessary,
    giving them plenty of room as you drive past.</li>
</ul>

<h2>207</h2>

<p><strong>Particularly vulnerable pedestrians.</strong> These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children and older pedestrians who may not be able to judge your
    speed and could step into the road in front of you. At 40 mph (64
    km/h) your vehicle will probably kill any pedestrians it hits. At
    20 mph (32 km/h) there is only a 1 in 20 chance of the pedestrian
    being killed. So kill your speed</li>

  <li>older pedestrians who may need more time to cross the road. Be
    patient and allow them to cross in their own time. Do not hurry
    them by revving your engine or edging forward</li>

  <li>people with disabilities. People with hearing impairments may not
    be aware of your vehicle approaching. Those with walking
    difficulties require more time</li>

  <li>blind or partially sighted people, who may be carrying a white
    cane using a guide dog. They may not be able to see you approaching</li>

  <li>deafblind people who may be carrying a white cane with a red band
    or using a dog with a red and white harness. They may not see or
    hear instructions or signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>208</h2>

<p><strong>Near schools.</strong> Drive slowly and be particularly
  aware of young cyclists and pedestrians. In some places, there may be
  a flashing amber signal below the &#8216;School&#8217; warning sign
  which tells you that there may be children crossing the road ahead.
  Drive very slowly until you are clear of the area.</p>

<h2>209</h2>

<p>Drive carefully and slowly when passing a stationary bus showing a
  &#8216;School Bus&#8217; sign (see &#8216;Vehicle markings&#8217;) as
  children may be getting on or off.</p>

<h2>210</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> stop when a school crossing patrol shows a
  &#8216;Stop for children&#8217; sign (see &#8216;Signals by
  authorised persons&#8217; and &#8216;Traffic signs&#8217;).<br>
