<h1>3. On the road (41 to 46)</h1>
</header>
<h2>41</h2>

<p>You should take care when travelling on the road as you may be
  travelling more slowly than other traffic (your machine is restricted
  to 8 mph (12 km/h) and may be less visible).</p>

<h2>42</h2>

<p>When on the road, Class 3 vehicles should travel in the direction of
  the traffic. Class 2 users should always use the pavement when it is
  available. When there is no pavement, you should use caution when on
  the road. Class 2 users should, where possible, travel in the
  direction of the traffic. If you are travelling at night when lights
  <strong>MUST</strong> be used, you should travel in the direction of
  the traffic to avoid confusing other road users.<br>
  <strong>Law UICHR 1988 reg 9</strong></p>

<h2>43</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> follow the same rules about using lights,
  indicators and horns as for other road vehicles, if your vehicle is
  fitted with them. At night, lights <strong>MUST</strong> be used. Be
  aware that other road users may not see you and you should make
  yourself more visible - even in the daytime and also at dusk - by,
  for instance, wearing a reflective jacket or reflective strips on the
  back of the vehicle.<br>
  <strong>Law UICHR 1988 reg 9</strong></p>

<h2>44</h2>

<p>Take extra care at road junctions. When going straight ahead, check
  to make sure there are no vehicles about to cross your path from the
  left, the right, or overtaking you and turning left. There are
  several options for dealing with right turns, especially turning from
  a major road. If moving into the middle of the road is difficult or
  dangerous, you can - stop on the left-hand side of the road and wait
  for a safe gap in the traffic - negotiate the turn as a pedestrian,
  i.e. travel along the pavement and cross the road between pavements
  where it is safe to do so. Class 3 users should switch the vehicle to
  the lower speed limit when on pavements.</p>

<p>If the junction is too hazardous, it may be worth considering an
  alternative route. Similarly, when negotiating major roundabouts
  (i.e. with two or more lanes) it may be safer for you to use the
  pavement or find a route which avoids the roundabout altogether.</p>

<h2>45</h2>

<p>All normal parking restrictions should be observed. Your vehicle
  should not be left unattended if it causes an obstruction to other
  pedestrians - especially those in wheelchairs. Parking concessions
  provided under the Blue Badge scheme (see Further reading and
  conversions) will apply to those vehicles displaying a valid badge.</p>

<h2>46</h2>

<p>These vehicles <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be used on motorways (see
  Rule 253). They should not be used on unrestricted dual carriageways
  where the speed limit exceeds 50 mph (80 km/h) but if they are used
  on these dual carriageways, they <strong>MUST</strong> have a
  flashing amber beacon. A flashing amber beacon should be used on all
  other dual carriageways (see Rule 220).<br>
