<h1>2. Road junctions (72 to 75)</h1>
</header>
<h2>72</h2>

<p><strong>On the left.</strong> When approaching a junction on the
  left, watch out for vehicles turning in front of you, out of or into
  the side road. Just before you turn, check for undertaking cyclists
  or motorcyclists. Do not ride on the inside of vehicles signalling or
  slowing down to turn left.</p>

<h2>73</h2>

<p>Pay particular attention to long vehicles which need a lot of room
  to manoeuvre at corners. Be aware that drivers may not see you. They
  may have to move over to the right before turning left. Wait until
  they have completed the manoeuvre because the rear wheels come very
  close to the kerb while turning. Do not be tempted to ride in the
  space between them and the kerb.</p>

<h2>74</h2>

<p><strong>On the right.</strong> If you are turning right, check the
  traffic to ensure it is safe, then signal and move to the centre of
  the road. Wait until there is a safe gap in the oncoming traffic and
  give a final look before completing the turn. It may be safer to wait
  on the left until there is a safe gap or to dismount and push your
  cycle across the road.</p>

<h2>75</h2>

<p><strong>Dual carriageways.</strong> Remember that traffic on most
  dual carriageways moves quickly. When crossing wait for a safe gap
  and cross each carriageway in turn. Take extra care when crossing
  slip roads.</p>
