<h1>3. Joining the motorway (259)</h1>
</header>
<h2>259</h2>

<p><strong>Joining the motorway.</strong> When you join the motorway
  you will normally approach it from a road on the left (a slip road)
  or from an adjoining motorway. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give priority to traffic already on the motorway</li>

  <li>check the traffic on the motorway and match your speed to fit
    safely into the traffic flow in the left-hand lane</li>

  <li>not cross solid white lines that separate lanes or use the hard
    shoulder</li>

  <li>stay on the slip road if it continues as an extra lane on the
    motorway</li>

  <li>remain in the left-hand lane long enough to adjust to the speed
    of traffic before considering overtaking.</li>
</ul>
