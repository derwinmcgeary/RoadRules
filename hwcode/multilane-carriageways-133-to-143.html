<h1>7. Multi-lane carriageways (133 to 143)</h1>
</header>
<h2>Lane discipline</h2>

<h2>133</h2>

<p>If you need to change lane, first use your mirrors and if necessary
  take a quick sideways glance to make sure you will not force another
  road user to change course or speed. When it is safe to do so, signal
  to indicate your intentions to other road users and when clear, move
  over.</p>

<h2>134</h2>

<p>You should follow the signs and road markings and get into the lane
  as directed. In congested road conditions do not change lanes
  unnecessarily. Merging in turn is recommended but only if safe and
  appropriate when vehicles are travelling at a very low speed, e.g.
  when approaching road works or a road traffic incident. It is not
  recommended at high speed.</p>

<h2>Single carriageway</h2>

<h2>135</h2>

<p>Where a single carriageway has three lanes and the road markings or
  signs do not give priority to traffic in either direction</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the middle lane only for overtaking or turning right.
    Remember, you have no more right to use the middle lane than a
    driver coming from the opposite direction</li>

  <li>do not use the right-hand lane.</li>
</ul>

<h2>136</h2>

<p>Where a single carriageway has four or more lanes, use only the
  lanes that signs or markings indicate.</p>

<h2>Dual carriageways</h2>

<p>A dual carriageway is a road which has a central reservation to
  separate the carriageways.</p>

<h2>137</h2>

<p>On a two-lane dual carriageway you should stay in the left-hand
  lane. Use the right-hand lane for overtaking or turning right. After
  overtaking, move back to the left-hand lane when it is safe to do so.</p>

<h2>138</h2>

<p>On a three-lane dual carriageway, you may use the middle lane or the
  right-hand lane to overtake but return to the middle and then the
  left-hand lane when it is safe.</p>

<h2>139</h2>

<p><strong>Climbing and crawler lanes.</strong> These are provided on
  some hills. Use this lane if you are driving a slow-moving vehicle or
  if there are vehicles behind you wishing to overtake. Be aware of the
  signs and road markings which indicate the lane is about to end.</p>

<h2>140</h2>

<p><strong>Cycle lanes.</strong> These are shown by road markings and
  signs. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive or park in a cycle lane
  marked by a solid white line during its times of operation. Do not
  drive or park in a cycle lane marked by a broken white line unless it
  is unavoidable. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> park in any cycle lane
  whilst waiting restrictions apply.<br>

<h2>141</h2>

<p><strong>Bus lanes.</strong> These are shown by road markings and
  signs that indicate which (if any) other vehicles are permitted to
  use the bus lane. Unless otherwise indicated, you should not drive in
  a bus lane during its period of operation. You may enter a bus lane
  to stop, to load or unload where this is not prohibited.</p>

<h2>142</h2>

<p><strong>High-occupancy vehicle lanes and other designated vehicle
  lanes.</strong> Lanes may be restricted for use by particular types
  of vehicle; these restrictions may apply some or all of the time. The
  operating times and vehicle types will be indicated on the
  accompanying traffic signs. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive in
  such lanes during their times of operation unless signs indicate that
  your vehicle is permitted.</p>

<p>See &#8216;Traffic signs&#8217; to see diagrams of traffic signs.</p>

<p>Vehicles permitted to use designated lanes may or may not include
  cycles, buses, taxis, licensed private hire vehicles, motorcycles,
  heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) and high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs). Where
  HOV lanes are in operation, they <strong>MUST ONLY</strong> be used
  by</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicles containing at least the minimum number of people
    indicated on the traffic signs</li>

  <li>any other vehicles, such as buses and motorcycles, as indicated
    on signs prior to the start of the lane, irrespective of the number
    of occupants.<br>
    <strong>Laws RTRA sects 5 &amp; 8, &amp; RTA 1988, sect 36</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>143</h2>

<p><strong>One-way streets.</strong> Traffic <strong>MUST</strong>
  travel in the direction indicated by signs. Buses and/or cycles may
  have a contraflow lane. Choose the correct lane for your exit as soon
  as you can. Do not change lanes suddenly. Unless road signs or
  markings indicate otherwise, you should use</p>

<ul>
  <li>the left-hand lane when going left</li>

  <li>the right-hand lane when going right</li>

  <li>the most appropriate lane when going straight ahead.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember &#8211; traffic could be passing on both sides.<br>
