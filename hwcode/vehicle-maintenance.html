<h1>1. Vehicle maintenance</h1>
</header>
<p>Take special care that lights, brakes, steering, exhaust system,
  seat belts, demisters, wipers and washers are all working. Also</p>

<ul>
  <li>lights, indicators, reflectors, and number plates
    <strong>MUST</strong> be kept clean and clear</li>

  <li>windscreens and windows <strong>MUST</strong> be kept clean and
    free from obstructions to vision</li>

  <li>lights <strong>MUST</strong> be properly adjusted to prevent
    dazzling other road users.</li>

  <li>Extra attention needs to be paid to this if the vehicle is
    heavily loaded</li>

  <li>exhaust emissions <strong>MUST NOT</strong> exceed prescribed
    levels</li>

  <li>ensure your seat, seat belt, head restraint and mirrors are
    adjusted correctly before you drive</li>

  <li>ensure that items of luggage are securely stowed.<br>
    <strong>Laws RVLR 1989 regs 23 &amp; 27 &amp; CUR 1986, regs 30
    &amp; 61</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Warning displays.</strong> Make sure that you understand the
  meaning of all warning displays on the vehicle instrument panel. Do
  not ignore warning signs, they could indicate a dangerous fault
  developing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you turn the ignition key, warning lights will be
    illuminated but will go out when the engine starts (except the
    handbrake warning light). If they do not, or if they come on while
    you are driving, stop and investigate the problem, as you could
    have a serious fault.</li>

  <li>If the charge warning light comes on while you are driving, it
    may mean that the battery isn&#8217;t charging. This should also be
    checked as soon as possible to avoid loss of power to lights and
    other electrical systems.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Window tints.</strong> You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use a
  vehicle with excessively dark tinting applied to the windscreen, or
  to the glass in any front window to either side of the driver. Window
  tinting applied during manufacture complies with the Visual Light
  Transmittance (VLT) standards. There are no VLT limits for rear
  windscreens or rear passenger windows.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 42 &amp; CUR reg 32</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tyres.</strong> Tyres <strong>MUST</strong> be correctly
  inflated to the vehicle manufacturer&#8217;s specification for the
  load being carried. Always refer to the vehicle&#8217;s handbook or
  data. Tyres should also be free from certain cuts and other defects.
  Cars, light vans and light trailers <strong>MUST</strong> have a
  tread depth of at least 1.6 mm across the central three-quarters of
  the breadth of the tread and around the entire circumference.
  Motorcycles, large vehicles and passenger-carrying vehicles MUST have
  a tread depth of at least 1 mm across three-quarters of the breadth
  of the tread and in a continuous band around the entire
  circumference. Mopeds should have visible tread. Be aware that some
  vehicle defects can attract penalty points.<br>
  <strong>Law CUR reg 27</strong></p>

<p>If a tyre bursts while you are driving, try to keep control of your
  vehicle. Grip the steering wheel firmly and allow the vehicle to roll
  to a stop at the side of the road.</p>

<p>If you have a flat tyre, stop as soon as it is safe to do so. Only
  change the tyre if you can do so without putting yourself or others
  at risk &#8211; otherwise call a breakdown service.</p>

<p><strong>Tyre pressures.</strong> Check weekly. Do this before your
  journey, when tyres are cold. Warm or hot tyres may give a misleading
  reading.</p>

<p>Your brakes and steering will be adversely affected by
  under-inflated or over-inflated tyres. Excessive or uneven tyre wear
  may be caused by faults in the braking or suspension systems, or
  wheels which are out of alignment. Have these faults corrected as
  soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Fluid levels.</strong> Check the fluid levels in your
  vehicle at least weekly. Low brake fluid may result in brake failure
  and a crash. Make sure you recognise the low fluid warning lights if
  your vehicle has them fitted.</p>

<p><strong>Before winter.</strong> Ensure that the battery is well
  maintained and that there are appropriate anti-freeze agents in your
  radiator and windscreen bottle.</p>

<p><strong>Other problems.</strong> If your vehicle</p>

<ul>
  <li>pulls to one side when braking, it is most likely to be a brake
    fault or incorrectly inflated tyres. Consult a garage or mechanic
    immediately</li>

  <li>continues to bounce after pushing down on the front or rear, its
    shock absorbers are worn. Worn shock absorbers can seriously affect
    the operation of a vehicle and should be replaced</li>

  <li>smells of anything unusual such as burning rubber, petrol or an
    electrical fault; investigate immediately. Do not risk a fire.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overheated engines or fire.</strong> Most engines are
  water-cooled. If your engine overheats you should wait until it has
  cooled naturally. Only then remove the coolant filler cap and add
  water or other coolant.</p>

<p>If your vehicle catches fire, get the occupants out of the vehicle
  quickly and to a safe place. Do not attempt to extinguish a fire in
  the engine compartment, as opening the bonnet will make the fire
  flare. Call the fire brigade.</p>

<p><strong>Petrol stations/fuel tank/fuel leaks.</strong> Ensure that,
  when filling up your vehicle&#8217;s tank or any fuel cans you are
  carrying, you do not spill fuel on the forecourt. Any spilled fuel
  should be immediately reported to the petrol station attendant.
  Diesel spillage is dangerous to other road users, particularly
  motorcyclists, as it will significantly reduce the level of grip
  between the tyres and road surface. Double-check for fuel leaks and
  make sure that - you do not overfill your fuel tank - the fuel cap is
  fastened securely - the seal in the cap is not torn, perished or
  missing - there is no visual damage to the cap or the fuel tank</p>

<p>Emergency fuel caps, if fitted, should form a good seal.</p>

<p>Never smoke, or use a mobile phone, on the forecourt of petrol
  stations as these are major fire risks and could cause an explosion.</p>
