<h1>2. Crossing the road (7 to 17)</h1>
</header>
<h2>7</h2>

<p><strong>The Green Cross Code.</strong> The advice given below on
  crossing the road is for all pedestrians. Children should be taught
  the Code and should not be allowed out alone until they can
  understand and use it properly. The age when they can do this is
  different for each child. Many children cannot judge how fast
  vehicles are going or how far away they are. Children learn by
  example, so parents and carers should always use the Code in full
  when out with their children. They are responsible for deciding at
  what age children can use it safely by themselves.</p>

<p>A. <strong>First find a safe place to cross</strong> and where there
  is space to reach the pavement on the other side. Where there is a
  crossing nearby, use it. It is safer to cross using a subway, a
  footbridge, an island, a zebra, pelican, toucan or puffin crossing,
  or where there is a crossing point controlled by a police officer, a
  school crossing patrol or a traffic warden. Otherwise choose a place
  where you can see clearly in all directions. Try to avoid crossing
  between parked cars (see Rule 14), on a blind bend, or close to the
  brow of a hill. Move to a space where drivers and riders can see you
  clearly. Do not cross the road diagonally.</p>

<p>B. <strong>Stop just before you get to the kerb,</strong> where you
  can see if anything is coming. Do not get too close to the traffic.
  If there&#8217;s no pavement, keep back from the edge of the road but
  make sure you can still see approaching traffic.</p>

<p>C. <strong>Look all around for traffic and listen.</strong> Traffic
  could come from any direction. Listen as well, because you can
  sometimes hear traffic before you see it.</p>

<p>D. <strong>If traffic is coming, let it pass.</strong> Look all
  around again and listen. Do not cross until there is a safe gap in
  the traffic and you are certain that there is plenty of time.
  Remember, even if traffic is a long way off, it may be approaching
  very quickly.</p>

<p>E. <strong>When it is safe, go straight across the road &#8211; do
  not run.</strong> Keep looking and listening for traffic while you
  cross, in case there is any traffic you did not see, or in case other
  traffic appears suddenly. Look out for cyclists and motorcyclists
  travelling between lanes of traffic. Do not walk diagonally across
  the road.</p>

<h2>8</h2>

<p><strong>At a junction.</strong> When crossing the road, look out for
  traffic turning into the road, especially from behind you. If you
  have started crossing and traffic wants to turn into the road, you
  have priority and they should give way (see Rule 170).</p>

<h2>9</h2>

<p><strong>Pedestrian Safety Barriers.</strong> Where there are
  barriers, cross the road only at the gaps provided for pedestrians.
  Do not climb over the barriers or walk between them and the road.</p>

<h2>10</h2>

<p><strong>Tactile paving.</strong> Raised surfaces that can be felt
  underfoot provide warning and guidance to blind or partially sighted
  people. The most common surfaces are a series of raised studs, which
  are used at crossing points with a dropped kerb, or a series of
  rounded raised bars which are used at level crossings, at the top and
  bottom of steps and at some other hazards.</p>

<h2>11</h2>

<p><strong>One-way streets.</strong> Check which way the traffic is
  moving. Do not cross until it is safe to do so without stopping. Bus
  and cycle lanes may operate in the opposite direction to the rest of
  the traffic.</p>

<h2>12</h2>

<p><strong>Bus and cycle lanes.</strong> Take care when crossing these
  lanes as traffic may be moving faster than in the other lanes, or
  against the flow of traffic.</p>

<h2>13</h2>

<p><strong>Routes shared with cyclists.</strong> Some cycle tracks run
  alongside footpaths or pavements, using a segregating feature to
  separate cyclists from people on foot. Segregated routes may also
  incorporate short lengths of tactile paving to help visually impaired
  people stay on the correct side. On the pedestrian side this will
  comprise a series of flat-topped bars running across the direction of
  travel (ladder pattern). On the cyclist side the same bars are
  orientated in the direction of travel (tramline pattern). Not all
  routes which are shared with cyclists are segregated. Take extra care
  where this is so (see Rule 62.</p>

<h2>14</h2>

<p><strong>Parked vehicles.</strong> If you have to cross between
  parked vehicles, use the outside edges of the vehicles as if they
  were the kerb. Stop there and make sure you can see all around and
  that the traffic can see you. Make sure there is a gap between any
  parked vehicles on the other side, so you can reach the pavement.
  Never cross the road in front of, or behind, any vehicle with its
  engine running, especially a large vehicle, as the driver may not be
  able to see you.</p>

<h2>15</h2>

<p><strong>Reversing vehicles.</strong> Never cross behind a vehicle
  which is reversing, showing white reversing lights or sounding a
  warning.</p>

<h2>16</h2>

<p><strong>Moving vehicles.</strong> You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> get
  onto or hold onto a moving vehicle.<br>
  <strong>Law RTA 1988 sect 26</strong></p>

<h2>17</h2>

<p><strong>At night.</strong> Wear something reflective to make it
  easier for others to see you (see Rule 3). If there is no pedestrian
  crossing nearby, cross the road near a street light so that traffic
  can see you more easily.</p>
