</header>
<h2>90</h2>

<p><strong>Make sure that you are fit to drive.</strong> You
  <strong>MUST</strong> report to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing
  Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>) any health
  condition likely to affect your driving.<br>
  <strong>Law RTA 1988 sect 94</strong></p>

<h2>91</h2>

<p>Driving when you are tired greatly increases your risk of collision.
  To minimise this risk</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure you are fit to drive. Do not begin a journey if you are
    tired. Get a good night&#8217;s sleep before embarking on a long
    journey</li>

  <li>avoid undertaking long journeys between midnight and 6 am, when
    natural alertness is at a minimum</li>

  <li>plan your journey to take sufficient breaks. A minimum break of
    at least 15 minutes after every two hours of driving is recommended</li>

  <li>if you feel at all sleepy, stop in a safe place. Do not stop on
    the hard shoulder of a motorway</li>

  <li>the most effective ways to counter sleepiness are to drink, for
    example, two cups of caffeinated coffee and to take a short nap (at
    least 15 minutes)</li>
</ul>

<h2>92</h2>

<p><strong>Vision.</strong> You <strong>MUST</strong> be able to read a
  vehicle number plate, in good daylight, from a distance of 20 metres
  (or 20.5 metres where the old style number plate is used). If you
  need to wear glasses (or contact lenses) to do this, you
  <strong>MUST</strong> wear them at all times while driving. The
  police have the power to require a driver to undertake an eyesight
  test.<br>

<h2>93</h2>

<p>Slow down, and if necessary stop, if you are dazzled by bright
  sunlight.</p>

<h2>94</h2>

<p>At night or in poor visibility, do not use tinted glasses, lenses or
  visors if they restrict your vision.</p>
