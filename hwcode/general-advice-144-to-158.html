<h1>8. General advice (144 to 158)</h1>
</header>
<h2>144</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>drive dangerously</li>

  <li>drive without due care and attention</li>

  <li>drive without reasonable consideration for other road
    users.<br>
    <strong>Law RTA 1988 sects 2 &amp; 3 as amended by RTA
    1991</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>145</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive on or over a pavement, footpath
  or bridleway except to gain lawful access to property, or in the case
  of an emergency.<br>
  <strong>Laws HA 1835 sect 72 &amp; RTA 1988 sect 34</strong></p>

<h2>146</h2>

<p><strong>Adapt your driving</strong> to the appropriate type and
  condition of road you are on. In particular</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not treat speed limits as a target. It is often not
    appropriate or safe to drive at the maximum speed limit</li>

  <li>take the road and traffic conditions into account. Be prepared
    for unexpected or difficult situations, for example, the road being
    blocked beyond a blind bend. Be prepared to adjust your speed as a
    precaution</li>

  <li>where there are junctions, be prepared for road users emerging</li>

  <li>in side roads and country lanes look out for unmarked junctions
    where nobody has priority</li>

  <li>be prepared to stop at traffic control systems, road works,
    pedestrian crossings or traffic lights as necessary</li>

  <li>try to anticipate what pedestrians and cyclists might do. If
    pedestrians, particularly children, are looking the other way, they
    may step out into the road without seeing you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>147</h2>

<p><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Be careful of and considerate
  towards all types of road users, especially those requiring extra
  care (see Rule 204).</p>

<ul>
  <li>you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> throw anything out of a vehicle;
    for example, food or food packaging, cigarette ends, cans, paper or
    carrier bags. This can endanger other road users, particularly
    motorcyclists and cyclists.</li>

  <li>try to be understanding if other road users cause problems; they
    may be inexperienced or not know the area well.</li>

  <li>be patient; remember that anyone can make a mistake.</li>

  <li>do not allow yourself to become agitated or involved if someone
    is behaving badly on the road. This will only make the situation
    worse. Pull over, calm down and, when you feel relaxed, continue
    your journey.</li>

  <li>slow down and hold back if a road user pulls out into your path
    at a junction. Allow them to get clear. Do not over-react by
    driving too close behind to intimidate them.<br>
    <strong>Law EPA 1990 sect 87</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>148</h2>

<p><strong>Safe driving and riding needs concentration.</strong> Avoid
  distractions when driving or riding such as</p>

<ul>
  <li>loud music (this may mask other sounds)</li>

  <li>trying to read maps</li>

  <li>inserting a cassette or CD or tuning a radio</li>

  <li>arguing with your passengers or other road users</li>

  <li>eating and drinking</li>

  <li>smoking</li>
</ul>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> smoke in public transport vehicles or
  in vehicles used for work purposes in certain prescribed
  circumstances. Separate regulations apply to England, Wales and
  Scotland.<br>
  <strong>Laws TSf(EV) regs 2007, TSfP(W) regs 2007 &amp; TPSCP(S) regs
  2006</strong></p>

<h2>Mobile phones and in-vehicle technology</h2>

<h2>149</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> exercise proper control of your vehicle at
  all times. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use a hand-held mobile
  phone, or similar device, when driving or when supervising a learner
  driver, except to call 999 or 112 in a genuine emergency when it is
  unsafe or impractical to stop. Never use a hand-held microphone when
  driving. Using hands-free equipment is also likely to distract your
  attention from the road. It is far safer not to use any telephone
  while you are driving or riding - find a safe place to stop first or
  use the voicemail facility and listen to messages later.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sects 2 &amp; 3 &amp; CUR regs 104 &amp;
  110</strong></p>

<h2>150</h2>

<p>There is a danger of driver distraction being caused by in-vehicle
  systems such as satellite navigation systems, congestion warning
  systems, PCs, multi-media, etc. You <strong>MUST</strong> exercise
  proper control of your vehicle at all times. Do not rely on driver
  assistance systems such as cruise control or lane departure warnings.
  They are available to assist but you should not reduce your
  concentration levels. Do not be distracted by maps or screen-based
  information (such as navigation or vehicle management systems) while
  driving or riding. If necessary find a safe place to stop.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sects 2 &amp; 3 &amp; CUR reg 104</strong></p>

<h2>151</h2>

<p><strong>In slow-moving traffic.</strong> You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce the distance between you and the vehicle ahead to maintain
    traffic flow</li>

  <li>never get so close to the vehicle in front that you cannot stop
    safely</li>

  <li>leave enough space to be able to manoeuvre if the vehicle in
    front breaks down or an emergency vehicle needs to get past</li>

  <li>not change lanes to the left to overtake</li>

  <li>allow access into and from side roads, as blocking these will add
    to congestion</li>

  <li>be aware of cyclists and motorcyclists who may be passing on
    either side.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Driving in built-up areas</h2>

<h2>152</h2>

<p><strong>Residential streets.</strong> You should drive slowly and
  carefully on streets where there are likely to be pedestrians,
  cyclists and parked cars. In some areas a 20 mph (32 km/h) maximum
  speed limit may be in force. Look out for</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicles emerging from junctions or driveways</li>

  <li>vehicles moving off</li>

  <li>car doors opening</li>

  <li>pedestrians</li>

  <li>children running out from between parked cars</li>

  <li>cyclists and motorcyclists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>153</h2>

<p><strong>Traffic-calming measures.</strong> On some roads there are
  features such as road humps, chicanes and narrowings which are
  intended to slow you down. When you approach these features reduce
  your speed. Allow cyclists and motorcyclists room to pass through
  them. Maintain a reduced speed along the whole of the stretch of road
  within the calming measures. Give way to oncoming road users if
  directed to do so by signs. You should not overtake other moving road
  users while in these areas.</p>

<p><img alt="Highway Code - Rule 153 Chicanes May Be Used To Slow Traffic Down" src="hc_rule_153_chicanes_may_be_used_to_slow_traffic_down.jpg" width="100%"></p>

<h2>Country roads</h2>

<h2>154</h2>

<p>Take extra care on country roads and reduce your speed at approaches
  to bends, which can be sharper than they appear, and at junctions and
  turnings, which may be partially hidden. Be prepared for pedestrians,
  horse riders, cyclists, slow-moving farm vehicles or mud on the road
  surface. Make sure you can stop within the distance you can see to be
  clear. You should also reduce your speed where country roads enter
  villages.</p>

<h2>155</h2>

<p><strong>Single-track roads.</strong> These are only wide enough for
  one vehicle. They may have special passing places. If you see a
  vehicle coming towards you, or the driver behind wants to overtake,
  pull into a passing place on your left, or wait opposite a passing
  place on your right. Give way to vehicles coming uphill whenever you
  can. If necessary, reverse until you reach a passing place to let the
  other vehicle pass. Slow down when passing pedestrians, cyclists and
  horse riders.</p>

<h2>156</h2>

<p>Do not park in passing places.</p>

<h2>Vehicles prohibited from using roads and pavements</h2>

<h2>157</h2>

<p>Certain motorised vehicles do not meet the construction and
  technical requirements for road vehicles and are generally not
  intended, not suitable and not legal for road, pavement, footpath,
  cycle path or bridleway use. These include most types of miniature
  motorcycles, also called mini motos, and motorised scooters, also
  called go peds, which are powered by electric or internal combustion
  engines. These types of vehicle <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be used on
  roads, pavements, footpaths or bridleways.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sects 34, 41a, 42, 47, 63 &amp; 66, HA 1835,
  sect 72, &amp; R(S)A sect 129</strong></p>

<h2>158</h2>

<p>Certain models of motorcycles, motor tricycles and quadricycles,
  also called quad bikes, are suitable only for off-road use and do not
  meet legal standards for use on roads. Vehicles that do not meet
  these standards <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be used on roads. They
  <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be used on pavements, footpaths, cycle
  paths or bridleways either. You <strong>MUST</strong> make sure that
  any motorcycle, motor tricycle, quadricycle or any other motor
  vehicle meets legal standards and is properly registered, taxed and
  insured before using it on the roads. Even when registered, taxed and
  insured for the road, vehicles <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be used on
  pavements.<br>
