<h1>8. Motor vehicle documentation and learner driver requirements</h1>
</header>
<h2>Documents</h2>

<p><strong>Driving licence.</strong> You <strong>MUST</strong> have a
  valid driving licence for the category of motor vehicle you are
  driving. You <strong>MUST</strong> inform the Driver and Vehicle
  Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>) if you
  change your name and/or address.<br>
  <strong>Law RTA 1988 sects 87 &amp; 99(4</strong>)</p>

<p>Holders of non-European Community licences who are now resident in
  the UK may only drive on that licence for a maximum of 12 months from
  the date they become resident in this country. To ensure continuous
  driving entitlement</p>

<ul>
  <li>a British provisional licence should be obtained and a driving
    test(s) passed before the 12-month period elapses, or</li>

  <li>in the case of a driver who holds a licence from a country which
    has been designated in law for licence exchange purposes, the
    driver should exchange the licence for a British one.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MOT.</strong> Cars and motorcycles <strong>MUST</strong>
  normally pass an MOT test three years from the date of the first
  registration and every year after that. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong>
  drive a motor vehicle without an MOT certificate when it should have
  one. Exceptionally, you may drive to a pre-arranged test appointment
  or to a garage for repairs required for the test. Driving an
  unroadworthy motor vehicle may invalidate your insurance. From
  November 2012, motor vehicles manufactured before 1960 will be
  exempted from an MOT requirement, although they can still be
  submitted for a test voluntarily. Owners are still legally required
  to ensure their vehicle is safe and roadworthy.<br>
  <strong>Law RTA 1988 sects 45, 47, 49 &amp; 53</strong></p>

<p><strong>Insurance.</strong> To use a motor vehicle on the road, you
  <strong>MUST</strong> have a valid insurance policy. This
  <strong>MUST</strong> at least cover you for injury or damage to a
  third party while using that motor vehicle. Before driving any motor
  vehicle, make sure that it has this cover for your use or that your
  own insurance provides adequate cover. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong>
  drive a motor vehicle without insurance. Also, be aware that even if
  a road traffic incident is not your fault, you may still be held
  liable by insurance companies.<br>
  <strong>Law RTA 1988 sect 143</strong></p>

<p>Uninsured drivers can now be automatically detected by roadside
  cameras. Further to the penalties for uninsured driving (see
  &#8216;Penalty table&#8217;), an offender&#8217;s vehicle can now be
  seized by the Police, taken away and crushed. <strong>Law RTA 1988,
  sects 165a &amp; 165b</strong></p>

<p>The types of cover available are indicated below:</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party insurance</strong> - this is often the cheapest
  form of insurance, and is the minimum cover required by law. It
  covers anyone you might injure or whose property you might damage. It
  does not cover damage to your own motor vehicle or injury to
  yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party, Fire and Theft insurance</strong> - similar to
  third-party, but also covers you against your motor vehicle being
  stolen, or damaged by fire.</p>

<p><strong>Comprehensive insurance</strong> - this is the most
  expensive but the best insurance. Apart from covering other persons
  and property against injury or damage, it also covers damage to your
  own motor vehicle, up to the market value of that vehicle, and
  personal injury to yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Registration certificate.</strong> Registration certificates
  (also called harmonised registration certificates) are issued for all
  motor vehicles used on the road, describing them (make, model, etc)
  and giving details of the registered keeper. You
  <strong>MUST</strong> notify the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency
  in Swansea as soon as possible when you buy or sell a motor vehicle,
  or if you change your name or address. For registration certificates
  issued after 27 March 1997, the buyer and seller are responsible for
  completing the registration certificates. The seller is responsible
  for forwarding them to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>. The
  procedures are explained on the back of the registration
  certificates.<br>
  <strong>Law RV(R&amp;L)R regs 21, 22, 23 &amp; 24</strong></p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Excise Duty (VED).</strong> Vehicle Excise Duty
  <strong>MUST</strong> be paid on all motor vehicles used or kept on
  public roads. <strong>Law VERA sects 29 and 33</strong></p>

<p><strong>Statutory Off-Road Notification (<abbr title="Statutory Off-Road Notification">SORN</abbr>).</strong> This
  is a notification to the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> that a motor
  vehicle is not being used on the road. If you are the vehicle keeper
  and want to keep a motor vehicle untaxed and off the public road you
  <strong>MUST</strong> declare <abbr title="Statutory Off-Road Notification">SORN</abbr> - it is an
  offence not to do so. The vehicle will remain <abbr title="Statutory Off-Road Notification">SORN</abbr> until you sell,
  tax or scrap it. If your vehicle is unused or off the road it MUST
  have either a <abbr title="Statutory Off-Road Notification">SORN</abbr> declaration or
  valid insurance. <strong>Law RV(RL)R 2002, reg 26 sched 4</strong></p>

<p><strong>Production of documents.</strong> You <strong>MUST</strong>
  be able to produce your driving licence, a valid insurance
  certificate and (if appropriate) a valid MOT certificate, when
  requested by a police officer. If you cannot do this you may be asked
  to take them to a police station within seven days.<br>
  <strong>Law RTA 1988 sects 164 &amp; 165</strong></p>

<h2>Learner drivers</h2>

<p>Learners driving a car MUST hold a valid provisional licence. They
  <strong>MUST</strong> be supervised by someone at least 21 years old
  who holds a full EC/EEA licence for that type of car (automatic or
  manual) and has held one for at least three years.<br>
  <strong>Laws MV(DL)R reg 16 &amp; RTA 1988 sect 87</strong></p>

<p><strong>Vehicles.</strong> Any vehicle driven by a learner
  <strong>MUST</strong> display red L plates. In Wales, either red D
  plates, red L plates, or both, can be used. Plates MUST conform to
  legal specifications and <strong>MUST</strong> be clearly visible to
  others from in front of the vehicle and from behind. Plates should be
  removed or covered when not being driven by a learner (except on
  driving school vehicles).<br>
  <strong>Law MV(DL)R reg 16 &amp; sched 4</strong></p>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> pass the theory test (if one is required)
  and then a practical driving test for the category of vehicle you
  wish to drive before driving unaccompanied.<br>
  <strong>Law MV(DL)R reg 40</strong></p>
