<p><strong>Before setting off.</strong> You should ensure that</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have planned your route and allowed sufficient time</li>

  <li>clothing and footwear do not prevent you using the controls in
    the correct manner</li>

    is too late to find out</li>

  <li>your mirrors and seat are adjusted correctly to ensure comfort,
    full control and maximum vision</li>

    and spine injuries in the event of a collision</li>

  <li>you have sufficient fuel before commencing your journey,
    especially if it includes motorway driving. It can be dangerous to
