<p>Cycle training can help both children and adults, especially those
  adults returning to cycling to develop the skills needed to cycle
  safely on today&#8217;s roads. A new national cycle training standard
  has been developed which the Government is promoting and making
  funding available for delivery in schools.</p>

  training. For information, contact your local authority.</p>
