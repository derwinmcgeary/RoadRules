<h2>98</h2>

<p><strong>Vehicle towing and loading.</strong> As a driver</p>

<ul>
  <li>you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> tow more than your licence permits.
    If you passed a car test after 1 Jan 1997 you are restricted on the
    weight of trailer you can tow</li>

  <li>you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> overload your vehicle or trailer.
    You should not tow a weight greater than that recommended by the
    manufacturer of your vehicle</li>

  <li>you <strong>MUST</strong> secure your load and it <strong>MUST
    NOT</strong> stick out dangerously. Make sure any heavy or sharp
    objects and any animals are secured safely. If there is a
    collision, they might hit someone inside the vehicle and cause
    serious injury</li>

  <li>you should properly distribute the weight in your caravan or
    trailer with heavy items mainly over the axle(s) and ensure a
    downward load on the tow ball. Manufacturer&#8217;s recommended
    weight and tow ball load should not be exceeded. This should avoid
    the possibility of swerving or snaking and going out of control. If
    this does happen, ease off the accelerator and reduce speed gently
    to regain control</li>

  <li>carrying a load or pulling a trailer may require you to adjust
    the headlights</li>
</ul>

<p>In the event of a breakdown, be aware that towing a vehicle on a tow
  rope is potentially dangerous. You should consider professional
  recovery.<br>
