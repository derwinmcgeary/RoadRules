<h1>5. Fog (234 to 236)</h1>
</header>
<h2>234</h2>

<p><strong>Before entering fog</strong> check your mirrors then slow
  down. If the word &#8216;Fog&#8217; is shown on a roadside signal but
  the road is clear, be prepared for a bank of fog or drifting patchy
  fog ahead. Even if it seems to be clearing, you can suddenly find
  yourself in thick fog.</p>

<h2>235</h2>

<p>When <strong>driving in fog</strong> you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>use your lights as required (see Rule 226)</li>

  <li>keep a safe distance behind the vehicle in front. Rear lights can
    give a false sense of security</li>

  <li>be able to pull up well within the distance you can see clearly.
    This is particularly important on motorways and dual carriageways,
    as vehicles are travelling faster</li>

  <li>use your windscreen wipers and demisters</li>

  <li>beware of other drivers not using headlights</li>

  <li>not accelerate to get away from a vehicle which is too close
    behind you</li>

  <li>check your mirrors before you slow down. Then use your brakes so
    that your brake lights warn drivers behind you that you are slowing
    down</li>

  <li>stop in the correct position at a junction with limited
    visibility and listen for traffic. When you are sure it is safe to
    emerge, do so positively and do not hesitate in a position that
    puts you directly in the path of approaching vehicles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>236</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use front or rear fog lights unless
  visibility is seriously reduced (see Rule 226) as they dazzle other
  road users and can obscure your brake lights. You
  <strong>MUST</strong> switch them off when visibility improves.<br>
