<p>This section should be read by all drivers, motorcyclists, cyclists
  and horse riders. The rules in <strong>The Highway Code</strong> do
  not give you the right of way in any circumstance, but they advise
  you when you should give way to others. Always give way if it can
  help to avoid an incident.</p>
