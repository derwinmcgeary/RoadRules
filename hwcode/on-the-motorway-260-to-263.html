<h1>4. On the motorway (260 to 263)</h1>
</header>
<h2>260</h2>

<p>When you can see well ahead and the road conditions are good, you
  should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>drive at a steady cruising speed which you and your vehicle can
    handle safely and is within the speed limit (see the Speed limits
    table)</li>

  <li>keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front and increase the
    gap on wet or icy roads, or in fog (see Rules 126 and 235).</li>
</ul>

<h2>261</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> exceed 70 mph (112 km/h), or the
  maximum speed limit permitted for your vehicle (see Speed limits
  table). If a lower speed limit is in force, either permanently or
  temporarily, at road works for example, you <strong>MUST NOT</strong>
  exceed the lower limit. On some motorways, mandatory motorway signals
  (which display the speed within a red ring) are used to vary the
  maximum speed limit to improve traffic flow. You <strong>MUST
  NOT</strong> exceed this speed limit.<br>

<h2>262</h2>

<p>The monotony of driving on a motorway can make you feel sleepy. To
  minimise the risk, follow the advice in Rule 91.</p>

<h2>263</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> reverse, cross the central
  reservation, or drive against the traffic flow. If you have missed
  your exit, or have taken the wrong route, carry on to the next
  exit.<br>
