<h1>2. On pavements (38 to 40)</h1>
</header>
<h2>38</h2>

<p>Pavements are safer than roads and should be used when available.
  You should give pedestrians priority and show consideration for other
  pavement users, particularly those with a hearing or visual
  impairment who may not be aware that you are there.</p>

<h2>39</h2>

<p>Powered wheelchairs and scooters <strong>MUST NOT</strong> travel
  faster than 4 mph (6 km/h) on pavements or in pedestrian areas. You
  may need to reduce your speed to adjust to other pavement users who
  may not be able to move out of your way quickly enough or where the
  pavement is too narrow.<br>
  <strong>Law UICHR 1988 reg 4</strong></p>

<h2>40</h2>

<p>When moving off the pavement onto the road, you should take special
  care. Before moving off, always look round and make sure it&#8217;s
  safe to join the traffic. Always try to use dropped kerbs when moving
  off the pavement, even if this means travelling further to locate
  one. If you have to climb or descend a kerb, always approach it at
  right angles and don&#8217;t try to negotiate a kerb higher than the
  vehicle manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations.</p>
