<h2>288</h2>

<p>When the &#8216;Road Works Ahead&#8217; sign is displayed, you will
  need to be more watchful and look for additional signs providing more
  specific instructions. Observe all signs - they are there for your
  safety and the safety of road workers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> exceed any temporary maximum speed
    limit.</li>

  <li>Use your mirrors and get into the correct lane for your vehicle
    in good time and as signs direct.</li>

  <li>Do not switch lanes to overtake queuing traffic.</li>

  <li>Take extra care near cyclists and motorcyclists as they are
    vulnerable to skidding on grit, mud or other debris at road works.</li>

  <li>Where lanes are restricted due to road works, merge in turn (see
    Rule 134).</li>

  <li>Do not drive through an area marked off by traffic cones.</li>

  <li>Watch out for traffic entering or leaving the works area, but do
    not be distracted by what is going on there. Concentrate on the
    road ahead, not the road works.</li>

  <li>Bear in mind that the road ahead may be obstructed by the works
    or by slow moving or stationary traffic.</li>

  <li>Keep a safe distance - there could be queues in front. To obtain
    further information about road works, see Conversions and further
    reading. <br>
