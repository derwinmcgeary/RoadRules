  (see &#8216;Vehicle markings&#8217;).</p>

<p>If an incident involves a vehicle containing dangerous goods, follow
  the advice in Rule 283 and, in particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>switch off engines and <strong>DO NOT SMOKE</strong></li>

  <li>keep well away from the vehicle and do not be tempted to try to
    rescue casualties as you yourself could become one</li>

  <li>call the emergency services and give as much information as
    possible about the labels and markings on the vehicle. <strong>DO
    NOT</strong> use a mobile phone close to a vehicle carrying
    flammable loads.</li>
