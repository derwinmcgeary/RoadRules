<h1>2. Additional rules for motorways (275 to 278)</h1>
</header>
<h2>275</h2>

<p>If your vehicle develops a problem, leave the motorway at the next
  exit or pull into a service area. If you cannot do so, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pull on to the hard shoulder and stop as far to the left as
    possible, with your wheels turned to the left</li>

  <li>try to stop near an emergency telephone (situated at
    approximately one-mile intervals along the hard shoulder)</li>

  <li>leave the vehicle by the left-hand door and ensure your
    passengers do the same. You <strong>MUST</strong> leave any animals
    in the vehicle or, in an emergency, keep them under proper control
    on the verge. Never attempt to place a warning triangle on a
    motorway</li>

  <li>do not put yourself in danger by attempting even simple repairs</li>

  <li>ensure that passengers keep away from the carriageway and hard
    shoulder, and that children are kept under control</li>

  <li>walk to an emergency telephone on your side of the carriageway
    (follow the arrows on the posts at the back of the hard shoulder)
    &#8211; the telephone is free of charge and connects directly to an
    operator. Use these in preference to a mobile phone (see Rule 283).
    Always face the traffic when you speak on the phone</li>

  <li>give full details to the operator; also inform them if you are a
    vulnerable motorist such as disabled, older or travelling alone</li>

  <li>return and wait near your vehicle (well away from the carriageway
    and hard shoulder)</li>

  <li>if you feel at risk from another person, return to your vehicle
    by a left-hand door and lock all doors. Leave your vehicle again as
    soon as you feel this danger has passed.<br>

</ul>

<h2>276</h2>

<p>Before you rejoin the carriageway after a breakdown, build up speed
  on the hard shoulder and watch for a safe gap in the traffic. Be
  aware that other vehicles may be stationary on the hard shoulder.</p>

<h2>277</h2>

<p>If you cannot get your vehicle onto the hard shoulder:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not attempt to place any warning device on the carriageway</li>

  <li>switch on your hazard warning lights</li>

  <li>leave your vehicle only when you can safely get clear of the
    carriageway.</li>
</ul>

<h2>278</h2>

<p><strong>Disabled drivers.</strong> If you have a disability which
  prevents you from following the above advice you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stay in your vehicle</li>

  <li>switch on your hazard warning lights</li>

  <li>display a &#8216;Help&#8217; pennant or, if you have a car or
    mobile telephone, contact the emergency services and be prepared to
    advise them of your location.</li>
</ul>
