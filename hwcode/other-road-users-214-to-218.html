<h1>4. Other road users (214 to 218)</h1>
</header>
<h2>214</h2>

<p><strong>Animals.</strong> When passing animals, drive slowly. Give
  them plenty of room and be ready to stop. Do not scare animals by
  sounding your horn, revving your engine or accelerating rapidly once
  you have passed them. Look out for animals being led, driven or
  ridden on the road and take extra care. Keep your speed down at bends
  and on narrow country roads. If a road is blocked by a herd of
  animals, stop and switch off your engine until they have left the
  road. Watch out for animals on unfenced roads.</p>

<h2>215</h2>

<p><strong>Horse riders and horse-drawn vehicles.</strong> Be
  particularly careful of horse riders and horse-drawn vehicles
  especially when overtaking. Always pass wide and slowly. Horse riders
  are often children, so take extra care and remember riders may ride
  in double file when escorting a young or inexperienced horse or
  rider. Look out for horse riders&#8217; and horse drivers&#8217;
  signals and heed a request to slow down or stop. Take great care and
  treat all horses as a potential hazard.</p>

<h2>216</h2>

<p><strong>Older drivers.</strong> Their reactions may be slower than
  other drivers. Make allowance for this.</p>

<h2>217</h2>

<p><strong>Learners and inexperienced drivers.</strong> They may not be
  so skilful at anticipating and responding to events. Be particularly
  patient with learner drivers and young drivers. Drivers who have
  recently passed their test may display a &#8216;new driver&#8217;
  plate or sticker (see Safety code for new drivers).</p>

<h2>218</h2>

<p>Home Zones and Quiet Lanes. These are places where people could be
  using the whole of the road for a range of activities such as
  children playing or for a community event. You should drive slowly
  and carefully and be prepared to stop to allow people extra time to
  make space for you to pass them in safety.</p>
