<h2>238</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> wait or park on yellow lines during
  the times of operation shown on nearby time plates (or zone entry
  signs if in a Controlled Parking Zone) &#8211; see &#8216;Traffic
  signs&#8217; and &#8216;Road markings&#8217;. Double yellow lines
  indicate a prohibition of waiting at any time even if there are no
  upright signs. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> wait or park, or stop to
  set down and pick up passengers, on school entrance markings (see
  &#8216;Road markings&#8217;) when upright signs indicate a
  prohibition of stopping.<br>
