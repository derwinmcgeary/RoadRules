<h2>107</h2>

<p>Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency officers have powers to stop
  vehicles on all roads, including motorways and trunk roads, in
  England and Wales. They will attract your attention by flashing amber
  lights</p>

<ul>
  <li>either from the front requesting you to follow them to a safe
    place to stop</li>

  <li>or from behind directing you to pull over to the side by pointing
    and/or using the left indicator.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is an offence not to comply with their directions. You
  <strong>MUST</strong> obey any signals given (see &#8216;Signals by
  authorised persons&#8217;).<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988, sect 67, &amp; PRA 2002, sect 41 &amp; sched

<h2>108</h2>

<p><strong>Traffic officers</strong> have powers to stop vehicles on
  most motorways and some &#8216;A&#8217; class roads, in England only.
  If traffic officers in uniform want to stop your vehicle on safety
  grounds (e.g. an insecure load) they will, where possible, attract
  your attention by</p>

<ul>
  <li>flashing amber lights, usually from behind</li>

  <li>directing you to pull over to the side by pointing and/or using
    the left indicator.</li>
</ul>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> then pull over and stop as soon as it is
  safe to do so. Then switch off your engine. It is an offence not to
  comply with their directions (see &#8216;Signals by authorised
  persons&#8217;).<br>
  <strong>Law RTA1988, sects 35 &amp;163 as amended by TMA 2004, sect
  6</strong></p>

<h2>109</h2>

<p><strong>Traffic light signals and traffic signs.</strong> You
  <strong>MUST</strong> obey all traffic light signals (see
  &#8216;Light signals controlling traffic&#8217;) and traffic signs
  giving orders, including temporary signals &amp; signs (see
  &#8216;Traffic signs&#8217;). Make sure you know, understand and act
  on all other traffic and information signs and road markings (see

  27, 28, 29, 36, 38 &amp; 40</strong></p>

<h2>110</h2>

<p><strong>Flashing headlights.</strong> Only flash your headlights to
  let other road users know that you are there. Do not flash your
  headlights to convey any other message or intimidate other road
  users.</p>

<h2>111</h2>

<p>Never assume that flashing headlights is a signal inviting you to
  proceed. Use your own judgement and proceed carefully.</p>

<h2>112</h2>

<p><strong>The horn.</strong> Use only while your vehicle is moving and
  you need to warn other road users of your presence. Never sound your
  horn aggressively. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use your horn</p>

  <li>while stationary on the road</li>

  <li>when driving in a built-up area between the hours of 11.30 pm and
