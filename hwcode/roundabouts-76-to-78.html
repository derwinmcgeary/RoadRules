<h1>3. Roundabouts (76 to 78)</h1>
</header>
<h2>76</h2>

<p>Full details about the correct procedure at roundabouts are
  contained in (see Rules 184 to 190). Roundabouts can be hazardous and
  should be approached with care.</p>

<h2>77</h2>

<p>You may feel safer walking your cycle round on the pavement or
  verge. If you decide to ride round keeping to the left-hand lane you
  should</p>

<ul>
  <li>be aware that drivers may not easily see you</li>

  <li>take extra care when cycling across exits. You may need to signal
    right to show you are not leaving the roundabout</li>

  <li>watch out for vehicles crossing your path to leave or join the
    roundabout.</li>
</ul>

<h2>78</h2>

<p>Give plenty of room to long vehicles on the roundabout as they need
  more space to manoeuvre. Do not ride in the space they need to get
  round the roundabout. It may be safer to wait until they have cleared
  the roundabout.</p>
