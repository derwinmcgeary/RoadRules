</header>
<p>These rules are in addition to those in the following sections,
  which apply to all vehicles (except the motorway section). See also
  You and your bicycle.</p>

<h2>59</h2>

<p><strong>Clothing.</strong> You should wear</p>

<ul>
  <li>a cycle helmet which conforms to current regulations, is the
    correct size and securely fastened</li>

  <li>appropriate clothes for cycling. Avoid clothes which may get
    tangled in the chain, or in a wheel or may obscure your lights</li>

  <li>light-coloured or fluorescent clothing which helps other road
    users to see you in daylight and poor light</li>

<h2>60</h2>

<p><strong>At night</strong> your cycle <strong>MUST</strong> have
  white front and red rear lights lit. It <strong>MUST</strong> also be
  fitted with a red rear reflector (and amber pedal reflectors, if
  manufactured after 1/10/85). White front reflectors and spoke
  reflectors will also help you to be seen. Flashing lights are
  permitted but it is recommended that cyclists who are riding in areas
  without street lighting use a steady front lamp.<br>
  <strong>Law RVLR regs 13, 18 &amp; 24</strong></p>

<h2>61</h2>

<p><strong>Cycle Routes and Other Facilities.</strong> Use cycle
  routes, advanced stop lines, cycle boxes and toucan crossings unless
  at the time it is unsafe to do so. Use of these facilities is not
  compulsory and will depend on your experience and skills, but they
  can make your journey safer.</p>

<h2>62</h2>

<p><strong>Cycle Tracks.</strong> These are normally located away from
  the road, but may occasionally be found alongside footpaths or
  pavements. Cyclists and pedestrians may be segregated or they may
  share the same space (unsegregated). When using segregated tracks you
  <strong>MUST</strong> keep to the side intended for cyclists as the
  pedestrian side remains a pavement or footpath. Take care when
  passing pedestrians, especially children, older or disabled people,
  and allow them plenty of room. Always be prepared to slow down and
  stop if necessary. Take care near road junctions as you may have
  difficulty seeing other road users, who might not notice you.<br>
  <strong>Law HA 1835 sect 72</strong></p>

<h2>63</h2>

<p><strong>Cycle Lanes.</strong> These are marked by a white line
  (which may be broken) along the carriageway (see Rule 140). Keep
  within the lane when practicable. When leaving a cycle lane check
  before pulling out that it is safe to do so and signal your intention
  clearly to other road users. Use of cycle lanes is not compulsory and
  will depend on your experience and skills, but they can make your
  journey safer.</p>

<h2>64</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> cycle on a pavement.<br>
  <strong>Laws HA 1835 sect 72 &amp; R(S)A 1984, sect 129</strong></p>

<h2>65</h2>

<p><strong>Bus Lanes.</strong> Most bus lanes may be used by cyclists
  as indicated on signs. Watch out for people getting on or off a bus.
  Be very careful when overtaking a bus or leaving a bus lane as you
  will be entering a busier traffic flow. Do not pass between the kerb
  and a bus when it is at a stop.</p>

<h2>66</h2>

<p>You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep both hands on the handlebars except when signalling or
    changing gear</li>

  <li>keep both feet on the pedals</li>

  <li>never ride more than two abreast, and ride in single file on
    narrow or busy roads and when riding round bends</li>

  <li>not ride close behind another vehicle</li>

  <li>not carry anything which will affect your balance or may get
    tangled up with your wheels or chain</li>

  <li>be considerate of other road users, particularly blind and
    partially sighted pedestrians. Let them know you are there when
    necessary, for example, by ringing your bell if you have one. It is
    recommended that a bell be fitted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>67</h2>

<p>You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>look all around before moving away from the kerb, turning or
    manoeuvring, to make sure it is safe to do so. Give a clear signal
    to show other road users what you intend to do (see &#8216;Signals
    to other road users&#8217;</li>

  <li>look well ahead for obstructions in the road, such as drains,
    pot-holes and parked vehicles so that you do not have to swerve
    suddenly to avoid them. Leave plenty of room when passing parked
    vehicles and watch out for doors being opened or pedestrians
    stepping into your path</li>

  <li>be aware of traffic coming up behind you</li>

  <li>take extra care near road humps, narrowings and other traffic
    calming features</li>

  <li>take care when overtaking (see Rules 162 to 169).</li>
</ul>

<h2>68</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>carry a passenger unless your cycle has been built or adapted to
    carry one</li>

  <li>hold onto a moving vehicle or trailer</li>

  <li>ride in a dangerous, careless or inconsiderate manner</li>

  <li>ride when under the influence of drink or drugs, including
    medicine.<br>
    <strong>Law RTA 1988 sects 24, 26, 28, 29 &amp; 30 as amended by
    RTA 1991</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>69</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> obey all traffic signs and traffic light
  signals.<br>
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD reg 10(1)</strong></p>

<h2>70</h2>

<p>When parking your cycle</p>

<ul>
  <li>find a conspicuous location where it can be seen by passers-by</li>

  <li>use cycle stands or other cycle parking facilities wherever
    possible</li>

  <li>do not leave it where it would cause an obstruction or hazard to
    other road users</li>

  <li>secure it well so that it will not fall over and become an
    obstruction or hazard.</li>
</ul>

<h2>71</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> cross the stop line when the traffic
  lights are red. Some junctions have an advanced stop line to enable
  you to wait and position yourself ahead of other traffic (see Rule
  178).<br>
