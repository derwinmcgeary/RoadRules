</article><article id="introduction" class="content-block"><header><h1>2. Introduction</h1>
  </header><p>This Highway Code applies to England, Scotland and Wales. The Highway Code is essential reading for everyone. </p>

<p>The most vulnerable road users are pedestrians, particularly 
children, older or disabled people, cyclists, motorcyclists and horse 
riders. It is important that all road users are aware of The Highway 
Code and are considerate towards each other. This applies to pedestrians
 as much as to drivers and riders.</p>

<p>Many of the rules in The Highway Code are legal requirements, and if 
you disobey these rules you are committing a criminal offence. You may 
be fined, given penalty points on your licence or be disqualified from 
driving. In the most serious cases you may be sent to prison. Such rules
 are identified by the use of the words <strong>‘MUST/MUST NOT’</strong>. In addition, the rule includes an abbreviated reference to the legislation which creates the offence. See an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/using-the-road-159-to-203/the-road-user-and-the-law">explanation of the abbreviations.</a></p>

<p>Although failure to comply with the other rules of The Highway Code 
will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, The Highway Code 
may be used in evidence in any court proceedings under the Traffic Acts 
(see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/using-the-road-159-to-203/the-road-user-and-the-law">The road user and the law</a> to establish liability. This includes rules which use advisory wording such as ‘should/should not’ or ‘do/do not’.</p>

<p>Knowing and applying the rules contained in The Highway Code could 
significantly reduce road casualties. Cutting the number of deaths and
injuries that occur on our roads every day is a responsibility we all 
share. The Highway Code can help us discharge that responsibility. 
Further information on driving/riding techniques can be found in ‘The 
Official <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> Guide to Driving - the essential skills’ and ‘The Official <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> Guide to Riding - the essential skills’.</p>
