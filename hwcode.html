      <h1>Introduction</h1>
    </header>

  <p>This Highway Code applies to England, Scotland and Wales. The Highway Code is essential reading for everyone. </p>

<p>The most vulnerable road users are pedestrians, particularly children, older or disabled people, cyclists, motorcyclists and horse riders. It is important that all road users are aware of The Highway Code and are considerate towards each other. This applies to pedestrians as much as to drivers and riders.</p>

<p>Many of the rules in The Highway Code are legal requirements, and if you disobey these rules you are committing a criminal offence. You may be fined, given penalty points on your licence or be disqualified from driving. In the most serious cases you may be sent to prison. Such rules are identified by the use of the words <strong>&#8216;MUST/MUST NOT&#8217;</strong>. In addition, the rule includes an abbreviated reference to the legislation which creates the offence. See an <a href="#the-road-user-and-the-law">explanation of the abbreviations.</a></p>

<p>Although failure to comply with the other rules of The Highway Code will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, The Highway Code may be used in evidence in any court proceedings under the Traffic Acts (see <a href="#the-road-user-and-the-law">The road user and the law</a> to establish liability. This includes rules which use advisory wording such as &#8216;should/should not&#8217; or &#8216;do/do not&#8217;.</p>

<p>Knowing and applying the rules contained in The Highway Code could significantly reduce road casualties. Cutting the number of deaths and
injuries that occur on our roads every day is a responsibility we all share. The Highway Code can help us discharge that responsibility. Further information on driving/riding techniques can be found in &#8216;The Official <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> Guide to Driving - the essential skills&#8217; and &#8216;The Official <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> Guide to Riding - the essential skills&#8217;.</p>

<h1>1. General guidance (1 to 6)</h1>
</header>
<h2>1</h2>

<p><strong>Pavements</strong> (including any path along the side of a
  road) should be used if provided. Where possible, avoid being next to
  the kerb with your back to the traffic. If you have to step into the
  road, look both ways first. Always show due care and consideration
  for others.</p>

<h2>2</h2>

<p><strong>If there is no pavement,</strong> keep to the right-hand
  side of the road so that you can see oncoming traffic. You should
  take extra care and</p>

<ul>
  <li>be prepared to walk in single file, especially on narrow roads or
    in poor light</li>

  <li>keep close to the side of the road.</li>
</ul>

<p>It may be safer to cross the road well before a sharp right-hand
  bend so that oncoming traffic has a better chance of seeing you.
  Cross back after the bend.</p>

<h2>3</h2>

<p><strong>Help other road users to see you.</strong> Wear or carry
  something light-coloured, bright or fluorescent in poor daylight
  conditions. When it is dark, use reflective materials (e.g. armbands,
  sashes, waistcoats, jackets, footwear), which can be seen by drivers
  using headlights up to three times as far away as non-reflective
  materials.</p>

<p><img alt="Highway Code - Rule 3 Help Yourself To Be Seen"
  height="250"
  src="images/hc_rule_3_help_yourself_to_be_seen.jpg"
  width="315" /></p>

<h2>4</h2>

<p><strong>Young children</strong> should not be out alone on the
  pavement or road (see Rule 7). When taking children out, keep between
  them and the traffic and hold their hands firmly. Strap very young
  children into push-chairs or use reins. When pushing a young child in
  a buggy, do not push the buggy into the road when checking to see if
  it is clear to cross, particularly from between parked vehicles.</p>

<h2>5</h2>

<p><strong>Organised walks.</strong> Large groups of people walking
  together should use a pavement if available; if one is not, they
  should keep to the left. Look-outs should be positioned at the front
  and back of the group, and they should wear fluorescent clothes in
  daylight and reflective clothes in the dark. At night, the look-out
  in front should show a white light and the one at the back a red
  light. People on the outside of large groups should also carry lights
  and wear reflective clothing.</p>

<h2>6</h2>

<p><strong>Motorways.</strong> Pedestrians <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be
  on motorways or slip roads except in an emergency (see Rule 271 and
  Rule 275).<br />

<h1>2. Crossing the road (7 to 17)</h1>
</header>
<h2>7</h2>

<p><strong>The Green Cross Code.</strong> The advice given below on
  crossing the road is for all pedestrians. Children should be taught
  the Code and should not be allowed out alone until they can
  understand and use it properly. The age when they can do this is
  different for each child. Many children cannot judge how fast
  vehicles are going or how far away they are. Children learn by
  example, so parents and carers should always use the Code in full
  when out with their children. They are responsible for deciding at
  what age children can use it safely by themselves.</p>

<p>A. <strong>First find a safe place to cross</strong> and where there
  is space to reach the pavement on the other side. Where there is a
  crossing nearby, use it. It is safer to cross using a subway, a
  footbridge, an island, a zebra, pelican, toucan or puffin crossing,
  or where there is a crossing point controlled by a police officer, a
  school crossing patrol or a traffic warden. Otherwise choose a place
  where you can see clearly in all directions. Try to avoid crossing
  between parked cars (see Rule 14), on a blind bend, or close to the
  brow of a hill. Move to a space where drivers and riders can see you
  clearly. Do not cross the road diagonally.</p>

<p><img
  alt="Highway Code - Rule 7 Look All Around And Listen For Traffic Before Crossing"
  height="250"
  src="images/hc_rule_7_look_all_around_and_listen_for_traffic_before_crossing.jpg"
  width="315" /></p>

<p>B. <strong>Stop just before you get to the kerb,</strong> where you
  can see if anything is coming. Do not get too close to the traffic.
  If there&#8217;s no pavement, keep back from the edge of the road but
  make sure you can still see approaching traffic.</p>

<p>C. <strong>Look all around for traffic and listen.</strong> Traffic
  could come from any direction. Listen as well, because you can
  sometimes hear traffic before you see it.</p>

<p>D. <strong>If traffic is coming, let it pass.</strong> Look all
  around again and listen. Do not cross until there is a safe gap in
  the traffic and you are certain that there is plenty of time.
  Remember, even if traffic is a long way off, it may be approaching
  very quickly.</p>

<p>E. <strong>When it is safe, go straight across the road &#8211; do
  not run.</strong> Keep looking and listening for traffic while you
  cross, in case there is any traffic you did not see, or in case other
  traffic appears suddenly. Look out for cyclists and motorcyclists
  travelling between lanes of traffic. Do not walk diagonally across
  the road.</p>

<h2>8</h2>

<p><strong>At a junction.</strong> When crossing the road, look out for
  traffic turning into the road, especially from behind you. If you
  have started crossing and traffic wants to turn into the road, you
  have priority and they should give way (see Rule 170).</p>

<h2>9</h2>

<p><strong>Pedestrian Safety Barriers.</strong> Where there are
  barriers, cross the road only at the gaps provided for pedestrians.
  Do not climb over the barriers or walk between them and the road.</p>

<h2>10</h2>

<p><strong>Tactile paving.</strong> Raised surfaces that can be felt
  underfoot provide warning and guidance to blind or partially sighted
  people. The most common surfaces are a series of raised studs, which
  are used at crossing points with a dropped kerb, or a series of
  rounded raised bars which are used at level crossings, at the top and
  bottom of steps and at some other hazards.</p>

<h2>11</h2>

<p><strong>One-way streets.</strong> Check which way the traffic is
  moving. Do not cross until it is safe to do so without stopping. Bus
  and cycle lanes may operate in the opposite direction to the rest of
  the traffic.</p>

<h2>12</h2>

<p><strong>Bus and cycle lanes.</strong> Take care when crossing these
  lanes as traffic may be moving faster than in the other lanes, or
  against the flow of traffic.</p>

<h2>13</h2>

<p><strong>Routes shared with cyclists.</strong> Some cycle tracks run
  alongside footpaths or pavements, using a segregating feature to
  separate cyclists from people on foot. Segregated routes may also
  incorporate short lengths of tactile paving to help visually impaired
  people stay on the correct side. On the pedestrian side this will
  comprise a series of flat-topped bars running across the direction of
  travel (ladder pattern). On the cyclist side the same bars are
  orientated in the direction of travel (tramline pattern). Not all
  routes which are shared with cyclists are segregated. Take extra care
  where this is so (see Rule 62.</p>

<h2>14</h2>

<p><strong>Parked vehicles.</strong> If you have to cross between
  parked vehicles, use the outside edges of the vehicles as if they
  were the kerb. Stop there and make sure you can see all around and
  that the traffic can see you. Make sure there is a gap between any
  parked vehicles on the other side, so you can reach the pavement.
  Never cross the road in front of, or behind, any vehicle with its
  engine running, especially a large vehicle, as the driver may not be
  able to see you.</p>

<h2>15</h2>

<p><strong>Reversing vehicles.</strong> Never cross behind a vehicle
  which is reversing, showing white reversing lights or sounding a
  warning.</p>

<h2>16</h2>

<p><strong>Moving vehicles.</strong> You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> get
  onto or hold onto a moving vehicle.<br />
  <strong>Law RTA 1988 sect 26</strong></p>

<h2>17</h2>

<p><strong>At night.</strong> Wear something reflective to make it
  easier for others to see you (see Rule 3). If there is no pedestrian
  crossing nearby, cross the road near a street light so that traffic
  can see you more easily.</p>

<header>
<h1>3. Crossings (18 to 30)</h1>
</header>
<h2>18</h2>

<p><strong>At all crossings.</strong> When using any type of crossing
  you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>always check that the traffic has stopped before you start to
    cross or push a pram onto a crossing</li>

  <li>always cross between the studs or over the zebra markings. Do not
    cross at the side of the crossing or on the zig-zag lines, as it
    can be dangerous.</li>
</ul>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> loiter on any type of crossing.<br />
  <strong>Laws ZPPPCRGD reg 19 &amp; RTRA sect 25(5)</strong></p>

<h2>19</h2>

<p><strong>Zebra crossings.</strong> Give traffic plenty of time to see
  you and to stop before you start to cross. Vehicles will need more
  time when the road is slippery. Wait until traffic has stopped from
  both directions or the road is clear before crossing. Remember that
  traffic does not have to stop until someone has moved onto the
  crossing. Keep looking both ways, and listening, in case a driver or
  rider has not seen you and attempts to overtake a vehicle that has
  stopped.</p>

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>20</h2>

<p>Where there is an island in the middle of a zebra crossing, wait on
  the island and follow Rule 19 before you cross the second half of the
  road &#8211; it is a separate crossing.</p>

<p><img

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>21</h2>

<p><strong>At traffic lights.</strong> There may be special signals for
  pedestrians. You should only start to cross the road when the green
  figure shows. If you have started to cross the road and the green
  figure goes out, you should still have time to reach the other side,
  but do not delay. If no pedestrian signals have been provided, watch
  carefully and do not cross until the traffic lights are red and the
  traffic has stopped. Keep looking and check for traffic that may be
  turning the corner. Remember that traffic lights may let traffic move
  in some lanes while traffic in other lanes has stopped.</p>

<p><img

  height="250"
  src="images/hc_rule_21_at_traffic_lights_puffin_and_pelican_crossings.jpg"
  width="315" /></p>

<h2>22</h2>

<p><strong>Pelican crossings.</strong> These are signal-controlled
  crossings operated by pedestrians. Push the control button to
  activate the traffic signals. When the red figure shows, do not
  cross. When a steady green figure shows, check the traffic has
  stopped then cross with care. When the green figure begins to flash
  you should not start to cross. If you have already started you should
  have time to finish crossing safely.</p>

<h2>23</h2>

<p><strong>Puffin crossings</strong> differ from pelican crossings as
  the red and green figures are above the control box on your side of
  the road and there is no flashing green figure phase. Press the
  button and wait for the green figure to show.</p>

<h3>24</h3>

<p>When the road is congested, traffic on your side of the road may be
  forced to stop even though their lights are green. Traffic may still
  be moving on the other side of the road, so press the button and wait
  for the signal to cross.</p>

<h2>25</h2>

<p><strong>Toucan crossings</strong> are light-controlled crossings
  which allow cyclists and pedestrians to share crossing space and
  cross at the same time. They are push-button operated. Pedestrians
  and cyclists will see the green signal together. Cyclists are
  permitted to ride across.</p>

<p><img
  alt="Highway Code - Rule 25 Toucan Crossings Can Be Used By Both Cyclists And Pedestrians"
  height="250"
  src="images/hc_rule_25_toucan_crossings_can_be_used_by_both_cyclists_and_pedestrians.jpg"
  width="315" /></p>

<h2>26</h2>

<p>At some crossings there is a bleeping sound or voice signal to
  indicate to blind or partially sighted people when the steady green
  figure is showing, and there may be a tactile signal to help
  deafblind people.</p>

<h2>27</h2>

<p><strong>Equestrian crossings</strong> are for horse riders. They
  have pavement barriers, wider crossing spaces, horse and rider
  figures in the light panels and either two sets of controls (one
  higher), or just one higher control panel.</p>

<p><img

  height="250"
  src="images/hc_rule_27_equestrian_crossings_are_used_by_horse_riders.jpg"
  width="315" /></p>

<p>There is often a parallel crossing.</p>

<h2>28</h2>

<p><strong>&#8216;Staggered&#8217; pelican or puffin
  crossings.</strong> When the crossings on each side of the central
  refuge are not in line they are two separate crossings. On reaching
  the central island, press the button again and wait for a steady
  green figure.</p>

<p>Image for Rule 28 &#8211; Staggered crossings (with an island in the
  middle) are two separate crossings<img

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>29</h2>

<p><strong>Crossings controlled by an authorised person.</strong> Do
  not cross the road unless you are signalled to do so by a police
  officer, traffic warden or school crossing patrol. Always cross in
  front of them.</p>

<h2>30</h2>

<p>Where there are no controlled crossing points available it is
  advisable to cross where there is an island in the middle of the
  road. Use the Green Cross Code (see Rule 7) to cross to the island
  and then stop and use it again to cross the second half of the road.</p>

<h1>4. Situations needing extra care (31 to 35)</h1>
</header>
<h2>31</h2>

<p><strong>Emergency vehicles.</strong> If an ambulance, fire engine,
  police or other emergency vehicle approaches using flashing blue
  lights, headlights and/or sirens, keep off the road.</p>

<h2>32</h2>

<p><strong>Buses.</strong> Get on or off a bus only when it has stopped
  to allow you to do so. Watch out for cyclists when you are getting
  off. Never cross the road directly behind or in front of a bus. Wait
  until it has moved off and you can see clearly in both directions.</p>

<h2>33</h2>

<p><strong>Tramways.</strong> These may run through pedestrian areas.
  Their path will be marked out by shallow kerbs, changes in the paving
  or other road surface, white lines or yellow dots. Cross at
  designated crossings where provided. Elsewhere treat trams as you
  would other road vehicles and look both ways along the track before
  crossing. Do not walk along the track as trams may come up behind
  you. Trams move quietly and cannot steer to avoid you.</p>

<h2>34</h2>

<p><strong>Railway level crossings.</strong> You <strong>MUST
  NOT</strong> cross or pass a stop line when the red lights show,
  (including a red pedestrian figure). Also do not cross if an alarm is
  sounding or the barriers are being lowered. The tone of the alarm may
  change if another train is approaching. If there are no lights,
  alarms or barriers, stop, look both ways and listen before crossing.
  A tactile surface comprising rounded bars running across the
  direction of pedestrian travel may be installed on the footpath
  approaching a level crossing to warn visually impaired people of its
  presence. The tactile surface should extend across the full width of
  the footway and should be located at an appropriate distance from the
  barrier or projected line of the barrier.<br />
  <strong>Law TSRGD, reg 52</strong></p>

<h2>35</h2>

<p><strong>Street and pavement repairs.</strong> A pavement may be
  closed temporarily because it is not safe to use. Take extra care if
  you are directed to walk in or to cross the road.</p>

<h2>36</h2>

<p>There is one class of manual wheelchair (called a Class 1 invalid
  carriage) and two classes of powered wheelchairs and powered mobility
  scooters. Manual wheelchairs and Class 2 vehicles are those with an
  upper speed limit of 4 mph (6 km/h) and are designed to be used on
  pavements. Class 3 vehicles are those with an upper speed limit of 8
  mph (12 km/h) and are equipped to be used on the road as well as the
  pavement.</p>

<h2>37</h2>

<p>When you are on the road you should obey the guidance and rules for
  other vehicles; when on the pavement you should follow the guidance
  and rules for pedestrians.</p>

<header>
<h1>2. On pavements (38 to 40)</h1>
</header>
<h2>38</h2>

<p>Pavements are safer than roads and should be used when available.
  You should give pedestrians priority and show consideration for other
  pavement users, particularly those with a hearing or visual
  impairment who may not be aware that you are there.</p>

<h2>39</h2>

<p>Powered wheelchairs and scooters <strong>MUST NOT</strong> travel
  faster than 4 mph (6 km/h) on pavements or in pedestrian areas. You
  may need to reduce your speed to adjust to other pavement users who
  may not be able to move out of your way quickly enough or where the
  pavement is too narrow.<br />
  <strong>Law UICHR 1988 reg 4</strong></p>

<h2>40</h2>

<p>When moving off the pavement onto the road, you should take special
  care. Before moving off, always look round and make sure it&#8217;s
  safe to join the traffic. Always try to use dropped kerbs when moving
  off the pavement, even if this means travelling further to locate
  one. If you have to climb or descend a kerb, always approach it at
  right angles and don&#8217;t try to negotiate a kerb higher than the
  vehicle manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations.</p>
</article> <article class="content-block" id="on-the-road-41-to-46">
<header>
<h1>3. On the road (41 to 46)</h1>
</header>
<h2>41</h2>

<p>You should take care when travelling on the road as you may be
  travelling more slowly than other traffic (your machine is restricted
  to 8 mph (12 km/h) and may be less visible).</p>

<h2>42</h2>

<p>When on the road, Class 3 vehicles should travel in the direction of
  the traffic. Class 2 users should always use the pavement when it is
  available. When there is no pavement, you should use caution when on
  the road. Class 2 users should, where possible, travel in the
  direction of the traffic. If you are travelling at night when lights
  <strong>MUST</strong> be used, you should travel in the direction of
  the traffic to avoid confusing other road users.<br />
  <strong>Law UICHR 1988 reg 9</strong></p>

<h2>43</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> follow the same rules about using lights,
  indicators and horns as for other road vehicles, if your vehicle is
  fitted with them. At night, lights <strong>MUST</strong> be used. Be
  aware that other road users may not see you and you should make
  yourself more visible - even in the daytime and also at dusk - by,
  for instance, wearing a reflective jacket or reflective strips on the
  back of the vehicle.<br />
  <strong>Law UICHR 1988 reg 9</strong></p>

<h2>44</h2>

<p>Take extra care at road junctions. When going straight ahead, check
  to make sure there are no vehicles about to cross your path from the
  left, the right, or overtaking you and turning left. There are
  several options for dealing with right turns, especially turning from
  a major road. If moving into the middle of the road is difficult or
  dangerous, you can - stop on the left-hand side of the road and wait
  for a safe gap in the traffic - negotiate the turn as a pedestrian,
  i.e. travel along the pavement and cross the road between pavements
  where it is safe to do so. Class 3 users should switch the vehicle to
  the lower speed limit when on pavements.</p>

<p>If the junction is too hazardous, it may be worth considering an
  alternative route. Similarly, when negotiating major roundabouts
  (i.e. with two or more lanes) it may be safer for you to use the
  pavement or find a route which avoids the roundabout altogether.</p>

<h2>45</h2>

<p>All normal parking restrictions should be observed. Your vehicle
  should not be left unattended if it causes an obstruction to other
  pedestrians - especially those in wheelchairs. Parking concessions
  provided under the Blue Badge scheme (see Further reading and
  conversions) will apply to those vehicles displaying a valid badge.</p>

<h2>46</h2>

<p>These vehicles <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be used on motorways (see
  Rule 253). They should not be used on unrestricted dual carriageways
  where the speed limit exceeds 50 mph (80 km/h) but if they are used
  on these dual carriageways, they <strong>MUST</strong> have a
  flashing amber beacon. A flashing amber beacon should be used on all
  other dual carriageways (see Rule 220).<br />

<p>Before you take a horse on to a road, you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure all tack fits well and is in good condition</li>

  <li>make sure you can control the horse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Always ride with other, less nervous horses if you think that your
  horse will be nervous of traffic. Never ride a horse without both a
  saddle and bridle.</p>

<h2>53</h2>

<p>Before riding off or turning, look behind you to make sure it is
  safe, then give a clear arm signal.</p>

<p>When riding on the road you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep to the left</li>

  <li>keep both hands on the reins unless you are signalling</li>

  <li>keep both feet in the stirrups</li>

  <li>not carry another person</li>

  <li>not carry anything which might affect your balance or get tangled
    up with the reins</li>

  <li>keep a horse you are leading to your left</li>

  <li>move in the direction of the traffic flow in a one-way street</li>

  <li>never ride more than two abreast, and ride in single file on
    narrow or busy roads and when riding round bends.</li>
</ul>

<h2>54</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> take a horse onto a footpath or
  pavement, and you should not take a horse onto a cycle track. Use a
  bridleway where possible. Equestrian crossings may be provided for
  horse riders to cross the road and you should use these where
  available (see Crossings). You should dismount at level crossings
  where a &#8216;horse rider dismount&#8217; sign is displayed.<br />
  <strong>Laws HA 1835 sect 72, R(S)A 1984, sect 129(5)</strong></p>

<h2>55</h2>

<p>Avoid roundabouts wherever possible. If you use them you should -
  keep to the left and watch out for vehicles crossing your path to
  leave or join the roundabout - signal right when riding across exits
  to show you are not leaving - signal left just before you leave the
  roundabout.</p>

<p><strong>Dogs.</strong> Do not let a dog out on the road on its own.
  Keep it on a short lead when walking on the pavement, road or path
  shared with cyclists or horse riders.</p>

<h2>57</h2>

<p>When in a vehicle make sure dogs or other animals are suitably
  restrained so they cannot distract you while you are driving or
  injure you, or themselves, if you stop quickly. A seat belt harness,
  pet carrier, dog cage or dog guard are ways of restraining animals in
  cars.</p>

<h2>58</h2>

<p><strong>Animals being herded.</strong> These should be kept under
  control at all times. You should, if possible, send another person
  along the road in front to warn other road users, especially at a
  bend or the brow of a hill. It is safer not to move animals after
  dark, but if you do, then wear reflective clothing and ensure that
  lights are carried (white at the front and red at the rear of the
  herd).</p>

<p><strong>Clothing.</strong> You should wear</p>

<ul>
  <li>a cycle helmet which conforms to current regulations, is the
    correct size and securely fastened</li>

  <li>appropriate clothes for cycling. Avoid clothes which may get

<h2>60</h2>

<p><strong>At night</strong> your cycle <strong>MUST</strong> have
  white front and red rear lights lit. It <strong>MUST</strong> also be
  fitted with a red rear reflector (and amber pedal reflectors, if
  manufactured after 1/10/85). White front reflectors and spoke
  reflectors will also help you to be seen. Flashing lights are
  permitted but it is recommended that cyclists who are riding in areas
  without street lighting use a steady front lamp.<br />
  <strong>Law RVLR regs 13, 18 &amp; 24</strong></p>

<h2>61</h2>

<p><strong>Cycle Routes and Other Facilities.</strong> Use cycle
  routes, advanced stop lines, cycle boxes and toucan crossings unless
  at the time it is unsafe to do so. Use of these facilities is not
  compulsory and will depend on your experience and skills, but they
  can make your journey safer.</p>

<h2>62</h2>

<p><strong>Cycle Tracks.</strong> These are normally located away from
  the road, but may occasionally be found alongside footpaths or
  pavements. Cyclists and pedestrians may be segregated or they may
  share the same space (unsegregated). When using segregated tracks you
  <strong>MUST</strong> keep to the side intended for cyclists as the
  pedestrian side remains a pavement or footpath. Take care when
  passing pedestrians, especially children, older or disabled people,
  and allow them plenty of room. Always be prepared to slow down and
  stop if necessary. Take care near road junctions as you may have
  difficulty seeing other road users, who might not notice you.<br />
  <strong>Law HA 1835 sect 72</strong></p>

<h2>63</h2>

<p><strong>Cycle Lanes.</strong> These are marked by a white line
  (which may be broken) along the carriageway (see Rule 140). Keep
  within the lane when practicable. When leaving a cycle lane check
  before pulling out that it is safe to do so and signal your intention
  clearly to other road users. Use of cycle lanes is not compulsory and
  will depend on your experience and skills, but they can make your
  journey safer.</p>

<h2>64</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> cycle on a pavement.<br />
  <strong>Laws HA 1835 sect 72 &amp; R(S)A 1984, sect 129</strong></p>

<h2>65</h2>

<p><strong>Bus Lanes.</strong> Most bus lanes may be used by cyclists
  as indicated on signs. Watch out for people getting on or off a bus.
  Be very careful when overtaking a bus or leaving a bus lane as you
  will be entering a busier traffic flow. Do not pass between the kerb
  and a bus when it is at a stop.</p>

<h2>66</h2>

<p>You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep both hands on the handlebars except when signalling or
    changing gear</li>

  <li>keep both feet on the pedals</li>

  <li>never ride more than two abreast, and ride in single file on
    narrow or busy roads and when riding round bends</li>

  <li>not ride close behind another vehicle</li>

  <li>not carry anything which will affect your balance or may get
    tangled up with your wheels or chain</li>

  <li>be considerate of other road users, particularly blind and
    partially sighted pedestrians. Let them know you are there when
    necessary, for example, by ringing your bell if you have one. It is
    recommended that a bell be fitted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>67</h2>

<p>You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>look all around before moving away from the kerb, turning or
    manoeuvring, to make sure it is safe to do so. Give a clear signal
    to show other road users what you intend to do (see &#8216;Signals
    to other road users&#8217;</li>

  <li>look well ahead for obstructions in the road, such as drains,
    pot-holes and parked vehicles so that you do not have to swerve
    suddenly to avoid them. Leave plenty of room when passing parked
    vehicles and watch out for doors being opened or pedestrians
    stepping into your path</li>

  <li>be aware of traffic coming up behind you</li>

  <li>take extra care near road humps, narrowings and other traffic
    calming features</li>

  <li>take care when overtaking (see Rules 162 to 169).</li>

<h2>68</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>carry a passenger unless your cycle has been built or adapted to
    carry one</li>

  <li>hold onto a moving vehicle or trailer</li>

  <li>ride in a dangerous, careless or inconsiderate manner</li>

  <li>ride when under the influence of drink or drugs, including
    medicine.<br />

<h2>72</h2>

<p><strong>On the left.</strong> When approaching a junction on the
  left, watch out for vehicles turning in front of you, out of or into
  the side road. Just before you turn, check for undertaking cyclists
  or motorcyclists. Do not ride on the inside of vehicles signalling or
  slowing down to turn left.</p>

<h2>73</h2>

<p>Pay particular attention to long vehicles which need a lot of room
  to manoeuvre at corners. Be aware that drivers may not see you. They
  may have to move over to the right before turning left. Wait until
  they have completed the manoeuvre because the rear wheels come very
  close to the kerb while turning. Do not be tempted to ride in the
  space between them and the kerb.</p>

<h2>74</h2>

<p><strong>On the right.</strong> If you are turning right, check the
  traffic to ensure it is safe, then signal and move to the centre of
  the road. Wait until there is a safe gap in the oncoming traffic and
  give a final look before completing the turn. It may be safer to wait
  on the left until there is a safe gap or to dismount and push your
  cycle across the road.</p>

<h2>75</h2>

<p><strong>Dual carriageways.</strong> Remember that traffic on most
  dual carriageways moves quickly. When crossing wait for a safe gap
  and cross each carriageway in turn. Take extra care when crossing
  slip roads.</p>

<h2>83</h2>

<p>On all journeys, the rider and pillion passenger on a motorcycle,
  scooter or moped <strong>MUST</strong> wear a protective helmet. This
  does not apply to a follower of the Sikh religion while wearing a
  turban. Helmets <strong>MUST</strong> comply with the Regulations and
  they <strong>MUST</strong> be fastened securely. Riders and
  passengers of motor tricycles and quadricycles, also called
  quadbikes, should also wear a protective helmet. Before each journey
  check that your helmet visor is clean and in good condition.<br />
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sects 16 &amp; 17 &amp; MC(PH)R as amended reg
  4</strong></p>

<h2>84</h2>

<p>It is also advisable to wear eye protectors, which
  <strong>MUST</strong> comply with the Regulations. Scratched or
  poorly fitting eye protectors can limit your view when riding,
  particularly in bright sunshine and the hours of darkness. Consider
  wearing ear protection. Strong boots, gloves and suitable clothing
  may help to protect you if you are involved in a collision.<br />
  <strong>Laws RTA sect 18 &amp; MC(EP)R as amended reg 4</strong></p>

<h2>85</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> carry more than one pillion passenger
  who <strong>MUST</strong> sit astride the machine on a proper seat.
  They should face forward with both feet on the footrests. You
  <strong>MUST NOT</strong> carry a pillion passenger unless your motor
  cycle is designed to do so. Provisional licence holders <strong>MUST
  NOT</strong> carry a pillion passenger.<br />

<h2>86</h2>

<p><strong>Daylight riding.</strong> Make yourself as visible as
  possible from the side as well as the front and rear. You could wear
  a light or brightly coloured helmet and fluorescent clothing or
  strips. Dipped headlights, even in good daylight, may also make you
  more conspicuous. However, be aware that other vehicle drivers may
  still not have seen you, or judged your distance or speed correctly,
  especially at junctions.</p>

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>87</h2>

<p><strong>Riding in the dark.</strong> Wear reflective clothing or
  strips to improve your visibility in the dark. These reflect light
  from the headlamps of other vehicles, making you visible from a
  longer distance. See Rules 113&#8211;116 for lighting requirements.</p>

<h2>88</h2>

<p><strong>Manoeuvring.</strong> You should be aware of what is behind
  and to the sides before manoeuvring. Look behind you; use mirrors if
  they are fitted. When in traffic queues look out for pedestrians
  crossing between vehicles and vehicles emerging from junctions or
  changing lanes. Position yourself so that drivers in front can see
  you in their mirrors. Additionally, when filtering in slow-moving
  traffic, take care and keep your speed low.</p>

<p>If you have a provisional motorcycle licence, you
  <strong>MUST</strong> satisfactorily complete a Compulsory Basic
  Training (CBT) course.</p>

<p>You can then ride unaccompanied on the public road a motorcycle up
  to 125 cc, with a power output not exceeding 11 kW, with L plates (in
  Wales either D plates or L plates, or both, can be used), for up to
  two years.</p>

<p>To ride a moped, learners <strong>MUST</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be 16 or over</li>

  <li>have a provisional moped licence</li>

  <li>complete CBT training.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can then ride unaccompanied on the public road a two-wheeled
  vehicle with a maximum design speed of 45 km/h (28 mph), with L
  plates (in Wales either D plates or L plates, or both, can be used),
  for up to two years.</p>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> first pass the theory test for motorcycles
  and then the moped practical test to obtain your full moped licence.</p>

<p>If you passed your car driving test before 1 February 2001 you are
  qualified to ride a moped without L plates (and/or D plates in
  Wales), although it is recommended that you complete CBT before
  riding on the road. If you passed your car driving test after this
  date you <strong>MUST</strong> complete CBT before riding a moped on
  the road.</p>

<h2>Licence categories for mopeds and motorcycles</h2>

<p><strong>Category AM (moped) &#8211; minimum age 16</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>two-wheeled vehicle with a maximum design speed of 45 km/h (28
    mph)</li>

  <li>three- or four-wheeled vehicle with a maximum design speed over
    25 km/h (15.5 mph), up to 50 cc and with a power output not
    exceeding 4 kW.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Category A1 &#8211; minimum age 17</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>motorcycles up to 125 cc, with a power output not exceeding 11 kW</li>

  <li>tricycles with a power output not exceeding 15 kW.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Category A2 &#8211; minimum age 19</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>motorcycles with a power output not exceeding 35 kW.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Category A</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>unrestricted motorcycles with a power output over 35 kW (minimum
    age 24 under direct access, or 21 under progressive access)</li>

  <li>tricycles with a power output over 15 kW (minimum age 21).</li>
</ul>

<p>Progressive access is a process that allows a rider to take a
  higher-category practical test if they already have at least two
  years&#8217; experience on a lower-category motorcycle. For example,
  if you have held a category A2 licence for a minimum of two years,
  you can take the category A practical test at age 21. There is no
  requirement to take another theory test.</p>

<p>If you want to learn to ride motorcycles larger than 125 cc and with
  a power output over 11 kW, you <strong>MUST</strong> meet the minimum
  age requirements, satisfactorily complete a CBT course and be
  accompanied by an approved instructor on another motorcycle in radio
  contact.</p>

<p>To obtain your full moped or motorcycle licence you
  <strong>MUST</strong> pass a motorcycle theory test and modules 1 and
  2 practical tests on a two-wheeled motorcycle.</p>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> carry a pillion passenger or pull a
  trailer until you have passed your test. Also see Rule 253 covering
  vehicles prohibited from motorways.<br />

  <strong>Law RTA 1988 sect 94</strong></p>

<h2>91</h2>

<p>Driving when you are tired greatly increases your risk of collision.
  To minimise this risk</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure you are fit to drive. Do not begin a journey if you are
    tired. Get a good night&#8217;s sleep before embarking on a long
    journey</li>

  <li>avoid undertaking long journeys between midnight and 6 am, when
    natural alertness is at a minimum</li>

  <li>plan your journey to take sufficient breaks. A minimum break of
    at least 15 minutes after every two hours of driving is recommended</li>

  <li>if you feel at all sleepy, stop in a safe place. Do not stop on
    the hard shoulder of a motorway</li>

  <li>the most effective ways to counter sleepiness are to drink, for
    example, two cups of caffeinated coffee and to take a short nap (at
    least 15 minutes)</li>
</ul>

<h2>92</h2>

<p><strong>Vision.</strong> You <strong>MUST</strong> be able to read a
  vehicle number plate, in good daylight, from a distance of 20 metres
  (or 20.5 metres where the old style number plate is used). If you
  need to wear glasses (or contact lenses) to do this, you

<p><strong>Do not drink and drive</strong> as it will seriously affect
  your judgement and abilities.</p>

<p>In England and Wales you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive with a
  breath alcohol level higher than 35 microgrammes/100 millilitres of
  breath or a blood alcohol level of more than 80 milligrammes/100
  millilitres of blood.</p>

<p>In Scotland the legal limits are lower. You <strong>MUST
  NOT</strong> drive with a breath alcohol level higher than 22
  microgrammes/100 millilitres of breath or a blood alcohol level of
  more than 50 milligrammes/100 millilitres of blood.</p>

<p>Alcohol will</p>

<ul>
  <li>give a false sense of confidence</li>

  <li>reduce co-ordination and slow down reactions</li>

  <li>affect judgement of speed, distance and risk</li>

  <li>reduce your driving ability, even if you&#8217;re below the legal
    limit</li>

  <li>take time to leave your body; you may be unfit to drive in the
    evening after drinking at lunchtime, or in the morning after
    drinking the previous evening</li>
</ul>

<p>The best solution is not to drink at all when planning to drive
  because any amount of alcohol affects your ability to drive safely.
  If you are going to drink, arrange another means of transport.<br />

<h2>96</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive under the influence of drugs or
  medicine. For medicines, check with your doctor or pharmacist and do
  not drive if you are advised that you may be impaired.</p>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive if you have illegal drugs or
  certain medicines in your blood above specified limits. It is highly
  dangerous so never take illegal drugs if you intend to drive; the
  effects are unpredictable, but can be even more severe than alcohol
  and result in fatal or serious road crashes. Illegal drugs have been
  specified at very low levels so even small amounts of use could be
  above the specified limits. The limits for certain medicines have
  been specified at higher levels, above the levels generally found in
  the blood of patients who have taken normal therapeutic doses. If you
  are found to have a concentration of a drug above its specified limit
  in your blood because you have been prescribed or legitimately
  supplied a particularly high dose of medicine, then you can raise a
  statutory medical defence, provided your driving was not impaired by
  the medicine you are taking.<br />

<p><strong>Before setting off.</strong> You should ensure that</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have planned your route and allowed sufficient time</li>

  <li>clothing and footwear do not prevent you using the controls in
    the correct manner</li>

  <li>you know where all the controls are and how to use them before

  <li>head restraints are properly adjusted to reduce the risk of neck
    and spine injuries in the event of a collision</li>

  <li>you have sufficient fuel before commencing your journey,

<h2>98</h2>

<p><strong>Vehicle towing and loading.</strong> As a driver</p>

<ul>
  <li>you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> tow more than your licence permits.
    If you passed a car test after 1 Jan 1997 you are restricted on the
    weight of trailer you can tow</li>

  <li>you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> overload your vehicle or trailer.
    You should not tow a weight greater than that recommended by the
    manufacturer of your vehicle</li>

  <li>you <strong>MUST</strong> secure your load and it <strong>MUST
    NOT</strong> stick out dangerously. Make sure any heavy or sharp
    objects and any animals are secured safely. If there is a
    collision, they might hit someone inside the vehicle and cause
    serious injury</li>

  <li>you should properly distribute the weight in your caravan or
    trailer with heavy items mainly over the axle(s) and ensure a
    downward load on the tow ball. Manufacturer&#8217;s recommended
    weight and tow ball load should not be exceeded. This should avoid
    the possibility of swerving or snaking and going out of control. If
    this does happen, ease off the accelerator and reduce speed gently
    to regain control</li>

  <li>carrying a load or pulling a trailer may require you to adjust
    the headlights</li>
</ul>

<p>In the event of a breakdown, be aware that towing a vehicle on a tow
  rope is potentially dangerous. You should consider professional
  recovery.<br />

<p>If you have a provisional motorcycle licence, you
  <strong>MUST</strong> satisfactorily complete a Compulsory Basic
  Training (<abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr>) course.
  You can then ride a motorcycle up to 125 cc with a power output not
  exceeding 11 kW on the public road, with L plates (in Wales either D
  plates, L plates or both can be used), for up to two years. Under
  direct access you can practise on a motorcycle that exceeds 125 cc
  provided that</p>

<ul>
  <li>you meet the minimum age for the category concerned</li>

  <li>you&#8217;re accompanied at all times by a qualified approved
    trainer, who is on another motorcycle and in radio contact with you</li>

  <li>fluorescent or reflective safety clothing is worn during
    supervision</li>

  <li>red L plates (D plates in Wales) are fitted and provisional
    licence restrictions followed.</li>
</ul>

<p>To obtain your full motorcycle licence you MUST pass a motorcycle
  theory test and then a practical test.<br />
  <strong>Law MV(DL)R regs 16 &amp; 68</strong></p>

<p><strong>A1 motorcycle licence:</strong> At age 17 or over, you take
  a test on a motorcycle without sidecar of between 120 and 125 cc. If
  you pass you may ride a motorcycle up to 125 cc with power output up
  to 11 kW, or a motor tricycle with power not exceeding 15 kW.</p>

<p><strong>A2 motorcycle licence:</strong> At age 19 or over, you take
  a test on a motorcycle without sidecar of at least 395 cc with a
  power output of at least 25 kW but not exceeding 35 kW. If you pass,
  you may ride any motorcycle not exceeding 35 kW and with a power to
  weight ratio not exceeding 0.2 kW/kg.</p>

<p><strong>Full A motorcycle licence:</strong> Test taken on a
  motorcycle without sidecar, of at least 595 cc and an engine power of
  at least 40 kW This gives you full access to all motorcycles and
  motor tricycles. You obtain a category A licence by taking
  progressive access from age 21, or under the direct access scheme
  from age 24.</p>

<p><strong>Category A under progressive access:</strong> You can take a
  category A practical test at age 21 if you already have an A2 licence
  that you&#8217;ve held for a minimum of two years. You don&#8217;t
  need to take another theory test or hold a <abbr
  title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr> certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Category A under direct access:</strong> This is for riders
  aged 24 or over. To obtain a category A licence you must</p>

<ul>
  <li>successfully complete a <abbr
    title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr> course</li>

  <li>pass the motorcycle theory test</li>

  <li>pass the practical motorcycle test.</li>
</ul>

<p>Passing the practical test on a motorcycle of at least 40 kW
  (53.6bhp) gives immediate access to all sizes of motorcycle.</p>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> carry a pillion passenger or pull a
  trailer until you have passed your test. Also see Rule 253 covering
  vehicles prohibited from motorways.<br />
  <strong>Law MV(DL)R reg 16</strong></p>

<h2>Moped licence requirements</h2>

<p>A moped <strong>MUST</strong> have an engine capacity not exceeding
  50 cc, not weigh more than 250kg and be designed to have a maximum
  speed not exceeding 28mph (45 km/h). Before June 2003 a licence
  allowed the riding of mopeds up to 50km/h.</p>

<p>To ride a moped, learners <strong>MUST</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>be 16 or over</li>

  <li>have a provisional moped licence</li>

  <li>complete <abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr>
    training.</li>
</ul>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> first pass the theory test for motorcycles
  and then the moped practical test to obtain your full moped licence.
  If you passed your car driving test before 1 February 2001 you are
  qualified to ride a moped without L plates (and/or D plates in
  Wales), although it is recommended that you complete <abbr
  title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr> before riding on the
  road. If you passed your car driving test after this date you
  <strong>MUST</strong> complete <abbr

<h2>Documents</h2>

<p><strong>Driving licence.</strong> You <strong>MUST</strong> have a
  valid driving licence for the category of motor vehicle you are
  driving. You <strong>MUST</strong> inform the Driver and Vehicle
  Licensing Agency (<abbr
  title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>) if you
  change your name and/or address.<br />
  <strong>Law RTA 1988 sects 87 &amp; 99(4</strong>)</p>

<p>Holders of non-European Community licences who are now resident in
  the UK may only drive on that licence for a maximum of 12 months from
  the date they become resident in this country. To ensure continuous
  driving entitlement</p>

<ul>
  <li>a British provisional licence should be obtained and a driving
    test(s) passed before the 12-month period elapses, or</li>

  <li>in the case of a driver who holds a licence from a country which
    has been designated in law for licence exchange purposes, the
    driver should exchange the licence for a British one.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MOT.</strong> Cars and motorcycles <strong>MUST</strong>
  normally pass an MOT test three years from the date of the first
  registration and every year after that. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong>
  drive a motor vehicle without an MOT certificate when it should have
  one. Exceptionally, you may drive to a pre-arranged test appointment
  or to a garage for repairs required for the test. Driving an
  unroadworthy motor vehicle may invalidate your insurance. From
  November 2012, motor vehicles manufactured before 1960 will be
  exempted from an MOT requirement, although they can still be
  submitted for a test voluntarily. Owners are still legally required
  to ensure their vehicle is safe and roadworthy.<br />
  <strong>Law RTA 1988 sects 45, 47, 49 &amp; 53</strong></p>

<p><strong>Insurance.</strong> To use a motor vehicle on the road, you
  <strong>MUST</strong> have a valid insurance policy. This
  <strong>MUST</strong> at least cover you for injury or damage to a
  third party while using that motor vehicle. Before driving any motor
  vehicle, make sure that it has this cover for your use or that your
  own insurance provides adequate cover. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong>
  drive a motor vehicle without insurance. Also, be aware that even if
  a road traffic incident is not your fault, you may still be held
  liable by insurance companies.<br />
  <strong>Law RTA 1988 sect 143</strong></p>

<p>Uninsured drivers can now be automatically detected by roadside
  cameras. Further to the penalties for uninsured driving (see
  &#8216;Penalty table&#8217;), an offender&#8217;s vehicle can now be
  seized by the Police, taken away and crushed. <strong>Law RTA 1988,
  sects 165a &amp; 165b</strong></p>

<p>The types of cover available are indicated below:</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party insurance</strong> - this is often the cheapest
  form of insurance, and is the minimum cover required by law. It
  covers anyone you might injure or whose property you might damage. It
  does not cover damage to your own motor vehicle or injury to
  yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party, Fire and Theft insurance</strong> - similar to
  third-party, but also covers you against your motor vehicle being
  stolen, or damaged by fire.</p>

<p><strong>Comprehensive insurance</strong> - this is the most
  expensive but the best insurance. Apart from covering other persons
  and property against injury or damage, it also covers damage to your
  own motor vehicle, up to the market value of that vehicle, and
  personal injury to yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Registration certificate.</strong> Registration certificates
  (also called harmonised registration certificates) are issued for all
  motor vehicles used on the road, describing them (make, model, etc)
  and giving details of the registered keeper. You
  <strong>MUST</strong> notify the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency
  in Swansea as soon as possible when you buy or sell a motor vehicle,
  or if you change your name or address. For registration certificates
  issued after 27 March 1997, the buyer and seller are responsible for
  completing the registration certificates. The seller is responsible
  for forwarding them to <abbr
  title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>. The
  procedures are explained on the back of the registration
  certificates.<br />
  <strong>Law RV(R&amp;L)R regs 21, 22, 23 &amp; 24</strong></p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Excise Duty (VED).</strong> Vehicle Excise Duty
  <strong>MUST</strong> be paid on all motor vehicles used or kept on
  public roads. <strong>Law VERA sects 29 and 33</strong></p>

<p><strong>Statutory Off-Road Notification (<abbr
  title="Statutory Off-Road Notification">SORN</abbr>).</strong> This
  is a notification to the <abbr
  title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> that a motor
  vehicle is not being used on the road. If you are the vehicle keeper
  and want to keep a motor vehicle untaxed and off the public road you
  <strong>MUST</strong> declare <abbr
  title="Statutory Off-Road Notification">SORN</abbr> - it is an
  offence not to do so. The vehicle will remain <abbr
  title="Statutory Off-Road Notification">SORN</abbr> until you sell,
  tax or scrap it. If your vehicle is unused or off the road it MUST
  have either a <abbr
  title="Statutory Off-Road Notification">SORN</abbr> declaration or
  valid insurance. <strong>Law RV(RL)R 2002, reg 26 sched 4</strong></p>

<p><strong>Production of documents.</strong> You <strong>MUST</strong>
  be able to produce your driving licence, a valid insurance
  certificate and (if appropriate) a valid MOT certificate, when
  requested by a police officer. If you cannot do this you may be asked
  to take them to a police station within seven days.<br />
  <strong>Law RTA 1988 sects 164 &amp; 165</strong></p>

<h2>Learner drivers</h2>

<p>Learners driving a car MUST hold a valid provisional licence. They
  <strong>MUST</strong> be supervised by someone at least 21 years old
  who holds a full EC/EEA licence for that type of car (automatic or
  manual) and has held one for at least three years.<br />
  <strong>Laws MV(DL)R reg 16 &amp; RTA 1988 sect 87</strong></p>

<p><strong>Vehicles.</strong> Any vehicle driven by a learner
  <strong>MUST</strong> display red L plates. In Wales, either red D
  plates, red L plates, or both, can be used. Plates MUST conform to
  legal specifications and <strong>MUST</strong> be clearly visible to
  others from in front of the vehicle and from behind. Plates should be
  removed or covered when not being driven by a learner (except on
  driving school vehicles).<br />
  <strong>Law MV(DL)R reg 16 &amp; sched 4</strong></p>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> pass the theory test (if one is required)
  and then a practical driving test for the category of vehicle you
  wish to drive before driving unaccompanied.<br />

  You should always</p>

<ul>
  <li>give clear signals in plenty of time, having checked it is not
    misleading to signal at that time</li>

  <li>use them to advise other road users before changing course or
    direction, stopping or moving off</li>

  <li>cancel them after use</li>

  <li>make sure your signals will not confuse others. If, for instance,
    you want to stop after a side road, do not signal until you are
    passing the road. If you signal earlier it may give the impression
    that you intend to turn into the road. Your brake lights will warn
    traffic behind you that you are slowing down</li>

  <li>use an arm signal to emphasise or reinforce your signal if
    necessary. Remember that signalling does not give you priority.</li>

<h2>104</h2>

<p>You should also</p>

<ul>
  <li>watch out for signals given by other road users and proceed only
    when you are satisfied that it is safe</li>

  <li>be aware that an indicator on another vehicle may not have been
    cancelled.</li>

  again.<br />
  <strong>Law RVLR reg 27</strong></p>

<h2>115</h2>

<p>You should also</p>

<ul>
  <li>use dipped headlights, or dim-dip if fitted, at night in built-up
    areas and in dull daytime weather, to ensure that you can be seen</li>

  <li>keep your headlights dipped when overtaking until you are level
    with the other vehicle and then change to main beam if necessary,
    unless this would dazzle oncoming road users</li>

  <li>slow down, and if necessary stop, if you are dazzled by oncoming
    headlights</li>
</ul>

<h2>116</h2>

<p><strong>Hazard warning lights.</strong> These may be used when your
  vehicle is stationary, to warn that it is temporarily obstructing
  traffic. Never use them as an excuse for dangerous or illegal
  parking. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use hazard warning lights
  while driving or being towed unless you are on a motorway or
  unrestricted dual carriageway and you need to warn drivers behind you
  of a hazard or obstruction ahead. Only use them for long enough to
  ensure that your warning has been observed.<br />

<h1>5. Control of the vehicle (117 to 126)</h1>

<h2>Braking</h2>

<h2>117</h2>

<p><strong>In normal circumstances.</strong> The safest way to brake is
  to do so early and lightly. Brake more firmly as you begin to stop.
  Ease the pressure off just before the vehicle comes to rest to avoid
  a jerky stop.</p>

<h2>118</h2>

<p><strong>In an emergency.</strong> Brake immediately. Try to avoid
  braking so harshly that you lock your wheels. Locked wheels can lead
  to loss of control.</p>

<h2>119</h2>

<p><strong>Skids.</strong> Skidding is usually caused by the driver
  braking, accelerating or steering too harshly or driving too fast for
  the road conditions. If skidding occurs, remove the cause by
  releasing the brake pedal fully or easing off the accelerator. Turn
  the steering wheel in the direction of the skid. For example, if the
  rear of the vehicle skids to the right, steer immediately to the
  right to recover.</p>

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>120</h2>

<p><strong>ABS.</strong> If your vehicle is fitted with anti-lock
  brakes, you should follow the advice given in the vehicle handbook.
  However, in the case of an emergency, apply the footbrake firmly; do
  not release the pressure until the vehicle has slowed to the desired
  speed. The ABS should ensure that steering control will be retained,
  but do not assume that a vehicle with ABS will stop in a shorter
  distance.</p>

<h2>121</h2>

<p><strong>Brakes affected by water.</strong> If you have driven
  through deep water your brakes may be less effective. Test them at
  the first safe opportunity by pushing gently on the brake pedal to
  make sure that they work. If they are not fully effective, gently
  apply light pressure while driving slowly. This will help to dry them
  out.</p>

<h2>122</h2>

<p><strong>Coasting.</strong> This term describes a vehicle travelling
  in neutral or with the clutch pressed down. It can reduce driver
  control because</p>

<ul>
  <li>engine braking is eliminated</li>

  <li>vehicle speed downhill will increase quickly</li>

  <li>increased use of the footbrake can reduce its effectiveness</li>

  <li>steering response will be affected, particularly on bends and
    corners</li>

  <li>it may be more difficult to select the appropriate gear when
    needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Driver and the Environment</h2>

<h2>123</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> leave a parked vehicle unattended with
  the engine running or leave a vehicle engine running unnecessarily
  while that vehicle is stationary on a public road. Generally, if the
  vehicle is stationary and is likely to remain so for more than a
  couple of minutes, you should apply the parking brake and switch off
  the engine to reduce emissions and noise pollution. However it is
  permissible to leave the engine running if the vehicle is stationary
  in traffic or for diagnosing faults.<br />

<p>*The 30 mph limit usually applies to all traffic on all roads with
  street lighting unless signs show otherwise. &#8224;60 mph (96 km/h)
  if articulated or towing a trailer</p>

<h2>Speed limits</h2>

<h2>124</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> exceed the maximum speed limits for
  the road and for your vehicle (see the table above). The presence of
  street lights generally means that there is a 30 mph (48 km/h) speed
  limit unless otherwise specified.<br />
  <strong>Law RTRA sects 81, 86, 89 &amp; sch 6 (as amended by the
  MV(VSL)(E&amp;W) regs 2014)</strong></p>

<h2>125</h2>

<p>The speed limit is the absolute maximum and does not mean it is safe
  to drive at that speed irrespective of conditions. Driving at speeds
  too fast for the road and traffic conditions is dangerous. You should
  always reduce your speed when</p>

<ul>
  <li>the road layout or condition presents hazards, such as bends</li>

  <li>sharing the road with pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders,
    particularly children, and motorcyclists</li>

  <li>weather conditions make it safer to do so</li>

  <li>driving at night as it is more difficult to see other road users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>126</h2>

<p><strong>Stopping Distances.</strong> Drive at a speed that will
  allow you to stop well within the distance you can see to be clear.
  You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>leave enough space between you and the vehicle in front so that
    you can pull up safely if it suddenly slows down or stops. The safe
    rule is never to get closer than the overall stopping distance (see
    Typical Stopping Distances diagram, shown below)</li>

  <li>allow at least a two-second gap between you and the vehicle in
    front on roads carrying faster-moving traffic and in tunnels where
    visibility is reduced. The gap should be at least doubled on wet
    roads and increased still further on icy roads</li>

  <li>remember, large vehicles and motorcycles need a greater distance
    to stop. If driving a large vehicle in a tunnel, you should allow a
    four-second gap between you and the vehicle in front.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have to stop in a tunnel, leave at least a 5-metre gap
  between you and the vehicle in front.</p>

<h2>127</h2>

<p><strong>A broken white line.</strong> This marks the centre of the
  road. When this line lengthens and the gaps shorten, it means that
  there is a hazard ahead. Do not cross it unless you can see the road
  is clear and wish to overtake or turn off.</p>

<h2>128</h2>

<p><strong>Double white lines where the line nearest to you is
  broken.</strong> This means you may cross the lines to overtake if it
  is safe, provided you can complete the manoeuvre before reaching a
  solid white line on your side. White direction arrows on the road
  indicate that you need to get back onto your side of the road.</p>

<h2>129</h2>

<p><strong>Double white lines where the line nearest you is
  solid.</strong> This means you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> cross or
  straddle it unless it is safe and you need to enter adjoining
  premises or a side road. You may cross the line if necessary,
  provided the road is clear, to pass a stationary vehicle, or overtake
  a pedal cycle, horse or road maintenance vehicle, if they are
  travelling at 10 mph (16 km/h) or less.<br />

<h2>130</h2>

<p><strong>Areas of white diagonal stripes</strong> or chevrons painted
  on the road. These are to separate traffic lanes or to protect
  traffic turning right.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the area is bordered by a broken white line, you should not
    enter the area unless it is necessary and you can see that it is
    safe to do so.</li>

<h2>132</h2>

<p><strong>Reflective road studs</strong> may be used with white lines.</p>

<ul>
  <li>White studs mark the lanes or the middle of the road.</li>

<h1>7. Multi-lane carriageways (133 to 143)</h1>
</header>
<h2>Lane discipline</h2>

<h2>133</h2>

<p>If you need to change lane, first use your mirrors and if necessary
  take a quick sideways glance to make sure you will not force another
  road user to change course or speed. When it is safe to do so, signal
  to indicate your intentions to other road users and when clear, move
  over.</p>

<h2>134</h2>

<p>You should follow the signs and road markings and get into the lane
  as directed. In congested road conditions do not change lanes
  unnecessarily. Merging in turn is recommended but only if safe and
  appropriate when vehicles are travelling at a very low speed, e.g.
  when approaching road works or a road traffic incident. It is not
  recommended at high speed.</p>

<h2>Single carriageway</h2>

<h2>135</h2>

<p>Where a single carriageway has three lanes and the road markings or
  signs do not give priority to traffic in either direction</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the middle lane only for overtaking or turning right.
    Remember, you have no more right to use the middle lane than a
    driver coming from the opposite direction</li>

  <li>do not use the right-hand lane.</li>
</ul>

<h2>136</h2>

<p>Where a single carriageway has four or more lanes, use only the
  lanes that signs or markings indicate.</p>

<h2>Dual carriageways</h2>

<p>A dual carriageway is a road which has a central reservation to
  separate the carriageways.</p>

<h2>137</h2>

<p>On a two-lane dual carriageway you should stay in the left-hand
  lane. Use the right-hand lane for overtaking or turning right. After
  overtaking, move back to the left-hand lane when it is safe to do so.</p>

<h2>138</h2>

<p>On a three-lane dual carriageway, you may use the middle lane or the
  right-hand lane to overtake but return to the middle and then the
  left-hand lane when it is safe.</p>

<h2>139</h2>

<p><strong>Climbing and crawler lanes.</strong> These are provided on
  some hills. Use this lane if you are driving a slow-moving vehicle or
  if there are vehicles behind you wishing to overtake. Be aware of the
  signs and road markings which indicate the lane is about to end.</p>

<h2>140</h2>

<p><strong>Cycle lanes.</strong> These are shown by road markings and
  signs. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive or park in a cycle lane
  marked by a solid white line during its times of operation. Do not
  drive or park in a cycle lane marked by a broken white line unless it
  is unavoidable. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> park in any cycle lane
  whilst waiting restrictions apply.<br />
  <strong>Law RTRA sects 5 &amp; 8</strong></p>

<h2>141</h2>

<p><strong>Bus lanes.</strong> These are shown by road markings and
  signs that indicate which (if any) other vehicles are permitted to
  use the bus lane. Unless otherwise indicated, you should not drive in
  a bus lane during its period of operation. You may enter a bus lane
  to stop, to load or unload where this is not prohibited.</p>

<h2>142</h2>

<p><strong>High-occupancy vehicle lanes and other designated vehicle
  lanes.</strong> Lanes may be restricted for use by particular types
  of vehicle; these restrictions may apply some or all of the time. The
  operating times and vehicle types will be indicated on the
  accompanying traffic signs. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive in
  such lanes during their times of operation unless signs indicate that
  your vehicle is permitted.</p>

<p>Vehicles permitted to use designated lanes may or may not include
  cycles, buses, taxis, licensed private hire vehicles, motorcycles,
  heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) and high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs). Where
  HOV lanes are in operation, they <strong>MUST ONLY</strong> be used
  by</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicles containing at least the minimum number of people
    indicated on the traffic signs</li>

  <li>any other vehicles, such as buses and motorcycles, as indicated
    on signs prior to the start of the lane, irrespective of the number
    of occupants.<br />

</ul>

<h2>143</h2>

<p><strong>One-way streets.</strong> Traffic MUST travel in the
  direction indicated by signs. Buses and/or cycles may have a
  contraflow lane. Choose the correct lane for your exit as soon as you
  can. Do not change lanes suddenly. Unless road signs or markings
  indicate otherwise, you should use</p>

<ul>
  <li>the left-hand lane when going left</li>

  <li>the right-hand lane when going right</li>

  <li>the most appropriate lane when going straight ahead.</li>

  or bridleway except to gain lawful access to property, or in the case
  of an emergency.<br />
  <strong>Laws HA 1835 sect 72 &amp; RTA 1988 sect 34</strong></p>

<h2>146</h2>

<p><strong>Adapt your driving</strong> to the appropriate type and
  condition of road you are on. In particular</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not treat speed limits as a target. It is often not
    appropriate or safe to drive at the maximum speed limit</li>

  <li>take the road and traffic conditions into account. Be prepared
    for unexpected or difficult situations, for example, the road being
    blocked beyond a blind bend. Be prepared to adjust your speed as a
    precaution</li>

  <li>where there are junctions, be prepared for road users emerging</li>

  <li>in side roads and country lanes look out for unmarked junctions
    where nobody has priority</li>

  <li>be prepared to stop at traffic control systems, road works,
    pedestrian crossings or traffic lights as necessary</li>

  <li>try to anticipate what pedestrians and cyclists might do. If
    pedestrians, particularly children, are looking the other way, they
    may step out into the road without seeing you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>147</h2>

<p><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Be careful of and considerate
  towards all types of road users, especially those requiring extra
  care (see Rule 204).</p>

<ul>
  <li>you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> throw anything out of a vehicle;
    for example, food or food packaging, cigarette ends, cans, paper or
    carrier bags. This can endanger other road users, particularly
    motorcyclists and cyclists.</li>

  <li>try to be understanding if other road users cause problems; they
    may be inexperienced or not know the area well.</li>

  <li>be patient; remember that anyone can make a mistake.</li>

  <li>do not allow yourself to become agitated or involved if someone
    is behaving badly on the road. This will only make the situation
    worse. Pull over, calm down and, when you feel relaxed, continue
    your journey.</li>

  <li>slow down and hold back if a road user pulls out into your path
    at a junction. Allow them to get clear. Do not over-react by
    driving too close behind to intimidate them.<br />
    <strong>Law EPA 1990 sect 87</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>148</h2>

<p><strong>Safe driving and riding needs concentration.</strong> Avoid
  distractions when driving or riding such as</p>

<ul>
  <li>loud music (this may mask other sounds)</li>

  <li>trying to read maps</li>

  <li>inserting a cassette or CD or tuning a radio</li>

  <li>arguing with your passengers or other road users</li>

  <li>eating and drinking</li>

  <li>smoking</li>
</ul>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> smoke in public transport vehicles or
  in vehicles used for work purposes in certain prescribed
  circumstances. Separate regulations apply to England, Wales and
  Scotland.<br />

<h2>Mobile phones and in-vehicle technology</h2>

<h2>149</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> exercise proper control of your vehicle at
  all times. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use a hand-held mobile
  phone, or similar device, when driving or when supervising a learner
  driver, except to call 999 or 112 in a genuine emergency when it is
  unsafe or impractical to stop. Never use a hand-held microphone when
  driving. Using hands-free equipment is also likely to distract your
  attention from the road. It is far safer not to use any telephone
  while you are driving or riding - find a safe place to stop first or
  use the voicemail facility and listen to messages later.<br />
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sects 2 &amp; 3 &amp; CUR regs 104 &amp;
  110</strong></p>

<h2>150</h2>

<p>There is a danger of driver distraction being caused by in-vehicle
  systems such as satellite navigation systems, congestion warning
  systems, PCs, multi-media, etc. You <strong>MUST</strong> exercise
  proper control of your vehicle at all times. Do not rely on driver
  assistance systems such as cruise control or lane departure warnings.
  They are available to assist but you should not reduce your
  concentration levels. Do not be distracted by maps or screen-based
  information (such as navigation or vehicle management systems) while
  driving or riding. If necessary find a safe place to stop.<br />
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sects 2 &amp; 3 &amp; CUR reg 104</strong></p>

<h2>151</h2>

<p><strong>In slow-moving traffic.</strong> You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce the distance between you and the vehicle ahead to maintain
    traffic flow</li>

  <li>never get so close to the vehicle in front that you cannot stop
    safely</li>

  <li>leave enough space to be able to manoeuvre if the vehicle in
    front breaks down or an emergency vehicle needs to get past</li>

  <li>not change lanes to the left to overtake</li>

  <li>allow access into and from side roads, as blocking these will add
    to congestion</li>

  <li>be aware of cyclists and motorcyclists who may be passing on
    either side.</li>

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>Driving in built-up areas</h2>

<h2>152</h2>

<p><strong>Residential streets.</strong> You should drive slowly and
  carefully on streets where there are likely to be pedestrians,
  cyclists and parked cars. In some areas a 20 mph (32 km/h) maximum
  speed limit may be in force. Look out for</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicles emerging from junctions or driveways</li>

  <li>vehicles moving off</li>

  <li>car doors opening</li>

  <li>pedestrians</li>

  <li>children running out from between parked cars</li>

  <li>cyclists and motorcyclists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>153</h2>

<p><strong>Traffic-calming measures.</strong> On some roads there are
  features such as road humps, chicanes and narrowings which are
  intended to slow you down. When you approach these features reduce
  your speed. Allow cyclists and motorcyclists room to pass through
  them. Maintain a reduced speed along the whole of the stretch of road
  within the calming measures. Give way to oncoming road users if
  directed to do so by signs. You should not overtake other moving road
  users while in these areas.</p>

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>Country roads</h2>

<h2>154</h2>

<p>Take extra care on country roads and reduce your speed at approaches
  to bends, which can be sharper than they appear, and at junctions and
  turnings, which may be partially hidden. Be prepared for pedestrians,
  horse riders, cyclists, slow-moving farm vehicles or mud on the road
  surface. Make sure you can stop within the distance you can see to be
  clear. You should also reduce your speed where country roads enter
  villages.</p>

<h2>155</h2>

<p><strong>Single-track roads.</strong> These are only wide enough for
  one vehicle. They may have special passing places. If you see a
  vehicle coming towards you, or the driver behind wants to overtake,
  pull into a passing place on your left, or wait opposite a passing
  place on your right. Give way to vehicles coming uphill whenever you
  can. If necessary, reverse until you reach a passing place to let the
  other vehicle pass. Slow down when passing pedestrians, cyclists and
  horse riders.</p>

<h2>156</h2>

<p>Do not park in passing places.</p>

<h2>Vehicles prohibited from using roads and pavements</h2>

<h2>157</h2>

<p>Certain motorised vehicles do not meet the construction and
  technical requirements for road vehicles and are generally not
  intended, not suitable and not legal for road, pavement, footpath,
  cycle path or bridleway use. These include most types of miniature
  motorcycles, also called mini motos, and motorised scooters, also
  called go peds, which are powered by electric or internal combustion
  engines. These types of vehicle <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be used on
  roads, pavements, footpaths or bridleways.<br />

</header>
<h2>159</h2>

<p>Before moving off you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>use all mirrors to check the road is clear</li>

  <li>look round to check the blind spots (the areas you are unable to
    see in the mirrors)</li>

  <li>signal if necessary before moving out</li>

  <li>look round for a final check.</li>
</ul>

<p>Move off only when it is safe to do so.</p>

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>160</h2>

<p>Once moving you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep to the left, unless road signs or markings indicate
    otherwise. The exceptions are when you want to overtake, turn right
    or pass parked vehicles or pedestrians in the road</li>

  <li>keep well to the left on right-hand bends. This will improve your
    view of the road and help avoid the risk of colliding with traffic
    approaching from the opposite direction</li>

  <li>drive with both hands on the wheel where possible. This will help
    you to remain in full control of the vehicle at all times</li>

  <li>be aware of other road users, especially cycles and motorcycles
    who may be filtering through the traffic. These are more difficult
    to see than larger vehicles and their riders are particularly
    vulnerable. Give them plenty of room, especially if you are driving
    a long vehicle or towing a trailer</li>

  <li>select a lower gear before you reach a long downhill slope. This
    will help to control your speed</li>

  <li>when towing, remember the extra length will affect overtaking and
    manoeuvring. The extra weight will also affect the braking and
    acceleration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>161</h2>

<p><strong>Mirrors.</strong> All mirrors should be used effectively
  throughout your journey. You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>use your mirrors frequently so that you always know what is
    behind and to each side of you</li>

  <li>use them in good time before you signal or change direction or
    speed</li>

  <li>be aware that mirrors do not cover all areas and there will be
    blind spots.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to look round and check.</p>

<p><strong>Remember: Mirrors &#8211; Signal &#8211; Manoeuvre</strong></p>

<h1>2. Overtaking (162 to 169)</h1>
</header>
<h2>162</h2>

<p><strong>Before overtaking</strong> you should make sure</p>

<ul>
  <li>the road is sufficiently clear ahead</li>

  <li>road users are not beginning to overtake you</li>

  <li>there is a suitable gap in front of the road user you plan to
    overtake.</li>
</ul>

<h2>163</h2>

<p><strong>Overtake only</strong> when it is safe and legal to do so.
  You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>not get too close to the vehicle you intend to overtake</li>

  <li>use your mirrors, signal when it is safe to do so, take a quick
    sideways glance if necessary into the blind spot area and then
    start to move out</li>

  <li>not assume that you can simply follow a vehicle ahead which is
    overtaking; there may only be enough room for one vehicle</li>

  <li>move quickly past the vehicle you are overtaking, once you have
    started to overtake. Allow plenty of room. Move back to the left as
    soon as you can but do not cut in</li>

  <li>take extra care at night and in poor visibility when it is harder
    to judge speed and distance</li>

  <li>give way to oncoming vehicles before passing parked vehicles or
    other obstructions on your side of the road</li>

  <li>only overtake on the left if the vehicle in front is signalling
    to turn right, and there is room to do so</li>

  <li>stay in your lane if traffic is moving slowly in queues. If the
    queue on your right is moving more slowly than you are, you may
    pass on the left</li>

  <li>give motorcyclists, cyclists and horse riders at least as much
    room as you would when overtaking a car (see Rules 211 to 213) and
    214 to 215).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Remember: Mirrors &#8211; Signal &#8211; Manoeuvre</strong></p>

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>164</h2>

<p><strong>Large vehicles.</strong> Overtaking these is more difficult.
  You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>drop back. This will increase your ability to see ahead and
    should allow the driver of the large vehicle to see you in their
    mirrors. Getting too close to large vehicles, including
    agricultural vehicles such as a tractor with a trailer or other
    fixed equipment, will obscure your view of the road ahead and there
    may be another slow-moving vehicle in front</li>

  <li>make sure that you have enough room to complete your overtaking
    manoeuvre before committing yourself. It takes longer to pass a
    large vehicle. If in doubt do not overtake</li>

  <li>not assume you can follow a vehicle ahead which is overtaking a
    long vehicle. If a problem develops, they may abort overtaking and
    pull back in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>165</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> overtake</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you would have to cross or straddle double white lines with a
    solid line nearest to you (but see Rule 129)</li>

  <li>if you would have to enter an area designed to divide traffic, if
    it is surrounded by a solid white line</li>

  <li>the nearest vehicle to a pedestrian crossing, especially when it
    has stopped to let pedestrians cross</li>

  <li>if you would have to enter a lane reserved for buses, trams or
    cycles during its hours of operation</li>

  <li>after a &#8216;No Overtaking&#8217; sign and until you pass a
    sign cancelling the restriction.<br />
    <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36, TSRGD regs 10, 22, 23 &amp; 24,
    ZPPPCRGD reg 24</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>166</h2>

<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> overtake if there is any doubt, or where you
  cannot see far enough ahead to be sure it is safe. For example, when
  you are approaching</p>

<ul>
  <li>a corner or bend</li>

  <li>a hump bridge</li>

  <li>the brow of a hill.</li>
</ul>

<h2>167</h2>

<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> overtake where you might come into conflict
  with other road users. For example</p>

<ul>
  <li>approaching or at a road junction on either side of the road</li>

  <li>where the road narrows</li>

  <li>when approaching a school crossing patrol</li>

  <li>between the kerb and a bus or tram when it is at a stop</li>

  <li>where traffic is queuing at junctions or road works</li>

  <li>when you would force another road user to swerve or slow down</li>

  <li>at a level crossing</li>

  <li>when a road user is indicating right, even if you believe the
    signal should have been cancelled. Do not take a risk; wait for the
    signal to be cancelled</li>

  <li>stay behind if you are following a cyclist approaching a
    roundabout or junction, and you intend to turn left</li>

  <li>when a tram is standing at a kerbside tram stop and there is no
    clearly marked passing lane for other traffic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>168</h2>

<p><strong>Being overtaken.</strong> If a driver is trying to overtake
  you, maintain a steady course and speed, slowing down if necessary to
  let the vehicle pass. Never obstruct drivers who wish to pass.
  Speeding up or driving unpredictably while someone is overtaking you
  is dangerous. Drop back to maintain a two-second gap if someone
  overtakes and pulls into the gap in front of you.</p>

<h2>169</h2>

<p>Do not hold up a long queue of traffic, especially if you are
  driving a large or slow-moving vehicle. Check your mirrors
  frequently, and if necessary, pull in where it is safe and let
  traffic pass.</p>

<h1>3. Road junctions (170 to 183)</h1>
</header>
<h2>170</h2>

<p>Take extra care at junctions. You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>watch out for cyclists, motorcyclists, powered
    wheelchairs/mobility scooters and pedestrians as they are not
    always easy to see. Be aware that they may not have seen or heard
    you if you are approaching from behind</li>

  <li>watch out for pedestrians crossing a road into which you are
    turning. If they have started to cross they have priority, so give
    way</li>

  <li>watch out for long vehicles which may be turning at a junction
    ahead; they may have to use the whole width of the road to make the
    turn (see Rule 221)</li>

  <li>watch out for horse riders who may take a different line on the
    road from that which you would expect</li>

  <li>not assume, when waiting at a junction, that a vehicle coming
    from the right and signalling left will actually turn. Wait and
    make sure</li>

  <li>look all around before emerging. Do not cross or join a road
    until there is a gap large enough for you to do so safely.</li>
</ul>

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>171</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> stop behind the line at a junction with a
  &#8216;Stop&#8217; sign and a solid white line across the road. Wait
  for a safe gap in the traffic before you move off.<br />
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10 &amp; 16</strong></p>

<h2>172</h2>

<p>The approach to a junction may have a &#8216;Give Way&#8217; sign or
  a triangle marked on the road. You <strong>MUST</strong> give way to
  traffic on the main road when emerging from a junction with broken
  white lines across the road.<br />
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10(1),16(1) &amp;
  25</strong></p>

<h2>173</h2>

<p><strong>Dual carriageways.</strong> When crossing or turning right,
  first assess whether the central reservation is deep enough to
  protect the full length of your vehicle.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If it is, then you should treat each half of the carriageway as a
    separate road. Wait in the central reservation until there is a
    safe gap in the traffic on the second half of the road.</li>

  <li>If the central reservation is too shallow for the length of your
    vehicle, wait until you can cross both carriageways in one go.</li>
</ul>

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>174</h2>

<p><strong>Box junctions.</strong> These have criss-cross yellow lines
  painted on the road (see &#8216;Road markings&#8217;). You
  <strong>MUST NOT</strong> enter the box until your exit road or lane
  is clear. However, you may enter the box and wait when you want to
  turn right, and are only stopped from doing so by oncoming traffic,
  or by other vehicles waiting to turn right. At signalled roundabouts
  you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> enter the box unless you can cross over
  it completely without stopping.<br />

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>Junctions controlled by traffic lights</h2>

<h2>175</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> stop behind the white &#8216;Stop&#8217;
  line across your side of the road unless the light is green. If the
  amber light appears you may go on only if you have already crossed
  the stop line or are so close to it that to stop might cause a
  collision.<br />
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10 &amp; 36</strong></p>

<h2>176</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> move forward over the white line when
  the red light is showing. Only go forward when the traffic lights are
  green if there is room for you to clear the junction safely or you
  are taking up a position to turn right. If the traffic lights are not
  working, treat the situation as you would an unmarked junction and
  proceed with great care.<br />
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10 &amp; 36</strong></p>

<h2>177</h2>

<p><strong>Green filter arrow.</strong> This indicates a filter lane
  only. Do not enter that lane unless you want to go in the direction
  of the arrow. You may proceed in the direction of the green arrow
  when it, or the full green light shows. Give other traffic,
  especially cyclists, time and room to move into the correct lane.</p>

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>178</h2>

<p><strong>Advanced stop lines.</strong> Some signal-controlled
  junctions have advanced stop lines to allow cycles to be positioned
  ahead of other traffic. Motorists, including motorcyclists,
  <strong>MUST</strong> stop at the first white line reached if the
  lights are amber or red and should avoid blocking the way or
  encroaching on the marked area at other times, e.g. if the junction
  ahead is blocked. If your vehicle has proceeded over the first white
  line at the time that the signal goes red, you <strong>MUST</strong>
  stop at the second white line, even if your vehicle is in the marked
  area. Allow cyclists time and space to move off when the green signal
  shows.<br />
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10, 36(1) &amp;
  43(2)</strong></p>

<h2>Turning right</h2>

<h2>179</h2>

<p><strong>Well before</strong> you turn right you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>use your mirrors to make sure you know the position and movement
    of traffic behind you</li>

  <li>give a right-turn signal</li>

  <li>take up a position just left of the middle of the road or in the
    space marked for traffic turning right</li>

  <li>leave room for other vehicles to pass on the left, if possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2>180</h2>

<p>Wait until there is a safe gap between you and any oncoming vehicle.
  Watch out for cyclists, motorcyclists, pedestrians and other road
  users. Check your mirrors and blind spot again to make sure you are
  not being overtaken, then make the turn. Do not cut the corner. Take
  great care when turning into a main road; you will need to watch for
  traffic in both directions and wait for a safe gap.</p>

<p><strong>Remember: Mirrors &#8211; Signal &#8211; Manoeuvre</strong></p>

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>181</h2>

<p><strong>When turning</strong> right at crossroads where an oncoming
  vehicle is also turning right, there is a choice of two methods</p>

<ul>
  <li>turn right side to right side; keep the other vehicle on your
    right and turn behind it. This is generally the safer method as you
    have a clear view of any approaching traffic when completing your
    turn</li>

  <li>left side to left side, turning in front of each other. This can
    block your view of oncoming vehicles, so take extra care. Cyclists
    and motorcyclists in particular may be hidden from your view. Road
    layout, markings or how the other vehicle is positioned can
    determine which course should be taken.</li>
</ul>

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>Turning left</h2>

<h2>182</h2>

<p>Use your mirrors and give a left-turn signal well before you turn
  left. Do not overtake just before you turn left and watch out for
  traffic coming up on your left before you make the turn, especially
  if driving a large vehicle. Cyclists, motorcyclists and other road
  users in particular may be hidden from your view.</p>

<h2>183</h2>

<p>When turning</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep as close to the left as is safe and practicable</li>

  <li>give way to any vehicles using a bus lane, cycle lane or tramway
    from either direction.</li>

<h2>184</h2>

<p><strong>On approaching a roundabout</strong> take notice and act on
  all the information available to you, including traffic signs,
  traffic lights and lane markings which direct you into the correct
  lane. You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>use <strong>Mirrors &#8211; Signal &#8211; Manoeuvre</strong> at
    all stages</li>

  <li>decide as early as possible which exit you need to take</li>

  <li>give an appropriate signal (see Rule 186, below). Time your

  <li>adjust your speed and position to fit in with traffic conditions</li>

  <li>be aware of the speed and position of all the road users around
    you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>185</h2>

<p><strong>When reaching the roundabout</strong> you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>give priority to traffic approaching from your right, unless
    directed otherwise by signs, road markings or traffic lights</li>

  <li>check whether road markings allow you to enter the roundabout
    without giving way. If so, proceed, but still look to the right
    before joining</li>

  <li>watch out for all other road users already on the roundabout; be

<p><strong>Signals and position</strong></p>

<p>When taking the first exit to the left, unless signs or markings
  indicate otherwise</p>

<ul>
  <li>signal left and approach in the left-hand lane</li>

  <li>keep to the left on the roundabout and continue signalling left

<h2>188</h2>

<p><strong>Mini-roundabouts.</strong> Approach these in the same way as
  normal roundabouts. All vehicles <strong>MUST</strong> pass round the
  central markings except large vehicles which are physically incapable
  of doing so. Remember, there is less space to manoeuvre and less time
  to signal. Avoid making U-turns at mini-roundabouts. Beware of others

  crossing, even when there is a central island. You
  <strong>MUST</strong> wait for pedestrians who are crossing from the
  other side of the island.<br />

<h2>199</h2>

<p><strong>Toucan, puffin and equestrian crossings.</strong> These are
  similar to pelican crossings, but there is no flashing amber phase;
  the light sequence for traffic at these three crossings is the same
  as at traffic lights. If the signal-controlled crossing is not

<h2>200</h2>

<p>Choose an appropriate place to manoeuvre. If you need to turn your
  vehicle around, wait until you find a safe place. Try not to reverse
  or turn round in a busy road; find a quiet side road or drive round a
  block of side streets.</p>

<h2>201</h2>

<p>Do not reverse from a side road into a main road. When using a
  driveway, reverse in and drive out if you can.</p>

<h1>7. The road user and the law</h1>
</header>
<p>The following list can be found abbreviated throughout the Code. It
  is not intended to be a comprehensive guide, but a guide to some of
  the important points of law. For the precise wording of the law,
  please refer to the various Acts and Regulations (as amended)
  indicated in the Code. Abbreviations are listed below.</p>

<p>Most of the provisions apply on all roads throughout Great Britain,
  although there are some exceptions. The definition of a road in
  England and Wales is &#8216;any highway and any other road to which
  the public has access and includes bridges over which a road
  passes&#8217; (RTA 1988 sect 192(1)). In Scotland, there is a similar
  definition which is extended to include any way over which the public
  have a right of passage (R(S)A 1984 sect 151(1)).</p>

<p>It is important to note that references to &#8216;road&#8217;
  therefore generally include footpaths, bridleways and cycle tracks,
  and many roadways and driveways on private land (including many car
  parks). In most cases, the law will apply to them and there may be
  additional rules for particular paths or ways. Some serious driving
  offences, including drink-driving offences, also apply to all public
  places, for example public car parks.</p>

<h1>1. Overview (204)</h1>
</header>
<h2>204</h2>

<p>The most vulnerable road users are pedestrians, cyclists,
  motorcyclists and horse riders. It is particularly important to be
  aware of children, older and disabled people, and learner and
  inexperienced drivers and riders.</p>
</article> <article class="content-block" id="pedestrians-205-to-210">
<header>
<h1>2. Pedestrians (205 to 210)</h1>
</header>
<h2>205</h2>

<p>There is a risk of pedestrians, especially children, stepping
  unexpectedly into the road. You should drive with the safety of
  children in mind at a speed suitable for the conditions.</p>

<h2>206</h2>

<p><strong>Drive carefully and slowly</strong> when</p>

<ul>
  <li>in crowded shopping streets, Home Zones and Quiet Lanes (see Rule
    218) or residential areas</li>

  <li>driving past bus and tram stops; pedestrians may emerge suddenly
    into the road</li>

  <li>passing parked vehicles, especially ice cream vans; children are
    more interested in ice cream than traffic and may run into the road
    unexpectedly</li>

  <li>needing to cross a pavement or cycle track; for example, to reach
    or leave a driveway. Give way to pedestrians and cyclists on the
    pavement</li>

  <li>reversing into a side road; look all around the vehicle and give
    way to any pedestrians who may be crossing the road</li>

  <li>turning at road junctions; give way to pedestrians who are
    already crossing the road into which you are turning</li>

  <li>the pavement is closed due to street repairs and pedestrians are
    directed to use the road</li>

  <li>approaching pedestrians on narrow rural roads without a footway
    or footpath. Always slow down and be prepared to stop if necessary,
    giving them plenty of room as you drive past.</li>
</ul>

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>207</h2>

<p><strong>Particularly vulnerable pedestrians.</strong> These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children and older pedestrians who may not be able to judge your
    speed and could step into the road in front of you. At 40 mph (64
    km/h) your vehicle will probably kill any pedestrians it hits. At
    20 mph (32 km/h) there is only a 1 in 20 chance of the pedestrian
    being killed. So kill your speed</li>

  <li>older pedestrians who may need more time to cross the road. Be
    patient and allow them to cross in their own time. Do not hurry
    them by revving your engine or edging forward</li>

  <li>people with disabilities. People with hearing impairments may not
    be aware of your vehicle approaching. Those with walking
    difficulties require more time</li>

  <li>blind or partially sighted people, who may be carrying a white
    cane using a guide dog. They may not be able to see you approaching</li>

  <li>deafblind people who may be carrying a white cane with a red band
    or using a dog with a red and white harness. They may not see or
    hear instructions or signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>208</h2>

<p><strong>Near schools.</strong> Drive slowly and be particularly
  aware of young cyclists and pedestrians. In some places, there may be
  a flashing amber signal below the &#8216;School&#8217; warning sign
  which tells you that there may be children crossing the road ahead.
  Drive very slowly until you are clear of the area.</p>

<h2>209</h2>

<p>Drive carefully and slowly when passing a stationary bus showing a
  &#8216;School Bus&#8217; sign (see &#8216;Vehicle markings&#8217;) as
  children may be getting on or off.</p>

<h2>210</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> stop when a school crossing patrol shows a
  &#8216;Stop for children&#8217; sign (see &#8216;Signals by
  authorised persons&#8217; and &#8216;Traffic signs&#8217;).<br />

<h1>3. Motorcyclists and cyclists (211 to 213)</h1>
</header>
<h2>211</h2>

<p>It is often difficult to see motorcyclists and cyclists, especially
  when they are coming up from behind, coming out of junctions, at
  roundabouts, overtaking you or filtering through traffic. Always look
  out for them before you emerge from a junction; they could be
  approaching faster than you think. When turning right across a line
  of slow-moving or stationary traffic, look out for cyclists or
  motorcyclists on the inside of the traffic you are crossing. Be
  especially careful when turning, and when changing direction or lane.
  Be sure to check mirrors and blind spots carefully.</p>

  width="315" /></p>

<h2>212</h2>

<p>When passing motorcyclists and cyclists, give them plenty of room
  (see Rules 162 to 167). If they look over their shoulder it could
  mean that they intend to pull out, turn right or change direction.
  Give them time and space to do so.</p>

<h2>213</h2>

<p>Motorcyclists and cyclists may suddenly need to avoid uneven road
  surfaces and obstacles such as drain covers or oily, wet or icy
  patches on the road. Give them plenty of room and pay particular
  attention to any sudden change of direction they may have to make.</p>

id="other-road-users-214-to-218"> <header>
<h1>4. Other road users (214 to 218)</h1>
</header>
<h2>214</h2>

<p><strong>Animals.</strong> When passing animals, drive slowly. Give
  them plenty of room and be ready to stop. Do not scare animals by
  sounding your horn, revving your engine or accelerating rapidly once
  you have passed them. Look out for animals being led, driven or
  ridden on the road and take extra care. Keep your speed down at bends
  and on narrow country roads. If a road is blocked by a herd of
  animals, stop and switch off your engine until they have left the
  road. Watch out for animals on unfenced roads.</p>

<h2>215</h2>

<p><strong>Horse riders and horse-drawn vehicles.</strong> Be
  particularly careful of horse riders and horse-drawn vehicles
  especially when overtaking. Always pass wide and slowly. Horse riders
  are often children, so take extra care and remember riders may ride
  in double file when escorting a young or inexperienced horse or
  rider. Look out for horse riders&#8217; and horse drivers&#8217;
  signals and heed a request to slow down or stop. Take great care and
  treat all horses as a potential hazard.</p>

<h2>216</h2>

<p><strong>Older drivers.</strong> Their reactions may be slower than
  other drivers. Make allowance for this.</p>

<h2>217</h2>

<p><strong>Learners and inexperienced drivers.</strong> They may not be
  so skilful at anticipating and responding to events. Be particularly
  patient with learner drivers and young drivers. Drivers who have
  recently passed their test may display a &#8216;new driver&#8217;
  plate or sticker (see Safety code for new drivers).</p>

<h2>218</h2>

<p>Home Zones and Quiet Lanes. These are places where people could be
  using the whole of the road for a range of activities such as
  children playing or for a community event. You should drive slowly
  and carefully and be prepared to stop to allow people extra time to
  make space for you to pass them in safety.</p>

<h1>5. Other vehicles (219 to 225)</h1>
</header>
<h2>219</h2>

<p><strong>Emergency and incident support vehicles.</strong> You should
  look and listen for ambulances, fire engines, police, doctors or
  other emergency vehicles using flashing blue, red or green lights and
  sirens or flashing headlights, or traffic officer and incident
  support vehicles using flashing amber lights. When one approaches do
  not panic. Consider the route of such a vehicle and take appropriate
  action to let it pass, while complying with all traffic signs. If
  necessary, pull to the side of the road and stop, but try to avoid
  stopping before the brow of a hill, a bend or narrow section of road.
  Do not endanger yourself, other road users or pedestrians and avoid
  mounting the kerb. Do not brake harshly on approach to a junction or
  roundabout, as a following vehicle may not have the same view as you.</p>

<h2>220</h2>

<p><strong>Powered vehicles used by disabled people.</strong> These
  small vehicles travel at a maximum speed of 8 mph (12 km/h). On a
  dual carriageway where the speed limit exceeds 50 mph (80 km/h) they
  <strong>MUST</strong> have a flashing amber beacon, but on other
  roads you may not have that advance warning (see Rules 36 to 46
  inclusive).</p>

<p><strong>Law RVLR reg 17(1) &amp; 26</strong></p>

<h2>221</h2>

<p><strong>Large vehicles.</strong> These may need extra road space to
  turn or to deal with a hazard that you are not able to see. If you
  are following a large vehicle, such as a bus or articulated lorry, be
  aware that the driver may not be able to see you in the mirrors. Be
  prepared to stop and wait if it needs room or time to turn.</p>

<p><img alt="Highway Code - Rule 221 Large Vehicles Need Extra Room"
  height="250"
  src="images/hc_rule_221_large_vehicles_need_extra_room.jpg"
  width="315" /></p>

<h2>222</h2>

<p>Large vehicles can block your view. Your ability to see and to plan
  ahead will be improved if you pull back to increase your separation
  distance. Be patient, as larger vehicles are subject to lower speed
  limits than cars and motorcycles. Many large vehicles may be fitted
  with speed limiting devices which will restrict speed to 56 mph (90
  km/h) even on a motorway.</p>

<h2>223</h2>

<p><strong>Buses, coaches and trams.</strong> Give priority to these
  vehicles when you can do so safely, especially when they signal to
  pull away from stops. Look out for people getting off a bus or tram
  and crossing the road.</p>

<h2>224</h2>

<p><strong>Electric vehicles.</strong> Be careful of electric vehicles
  such as milk floats and trams. Trams move quickly but silently and
  cannot steer to avoid you.</p>

<h2>225</h2>

<p><strong>Vehicles with flashing amber beacons.</strong> These warn of
  a slow-moving or stationary vehicle (such as a traffic officer
  vehicle, salt spreader, snow plough or recovery vehicle) or abnormal
  loads, so approach with caution. On unrestricted dual carriageways,
  motor vehicles first used on or after 1 January 1947 with a maximum
  speed of 25 mph (40 km/h) or less (such as tractors)
  <strong>MUST</strong> use a flashing amber beacon (also see Rule 220
  above). <strong>Law RVLR 1989, reg 17</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>drive with care, even if the roads have been treated</li>

  <li>keep well back from the road user in front as stopping distances
    can be ten times greater than on dry roads</li>

  <li>take care when overtaking vehicles spreading salt or other

    conditions ahead.</li>
</ul>

<h2>231</h2>

<p><strong>Drive extremely carefully</strong> when the roads are icy.
  Avoid sudden actions as these could cause loss of control. You should</p>

<ul>
  <li>drive at a slow speed in as high a gear as possible; accelerate
    and brake very gently</li>

  <li>drive particularly slowly on bends where loss of control is more
    likely. Brake progressively on the straight before you reach a
    bend. Having slowed down, steer smoothly round the bend, avoiding
    sudden actions</li>

  <li>check your grip on the road surface when there is snow or ice by
    choosing a safe place to brake gently. If the steering feels
    unresponsive this may indicate ice and your vehicle losing its grip
    on the road. When travelling on ice, tyres make virtually no noise.</li>

<h2>234</h2>

<p><strong>Before entering fog</strong> check your mirrors then slow
  down. If the word &#8216;Fog&#8217; is shown on a roadside signal but

  <li>keep a safe distance behind the vehicle in front. Rear lights can
    give a false sense of security</li>

  <li>be able to pull up well within the distance you can see clearly.

  <li>beware of other drivers not using headlights</li>

  <li>not accelerate to get away from a vehicle which is too close
    behind you</li>

  <li>check your mirrors before you slow down. Then use your brakes so

<h2>255</h2>

<p>Motorway signals (see &#8216;Light signals controlling
  traffic&#8217;) are used to warn you of a danger ahead. For example,
  there may be an incident, fog, a spillage or road workers on the
  carriageway which you may not immediately be able to see.</p>

<h2>256</h2>

<p>Signals situated on the central reservation apply to all lanes. On
  very busy stretches, signals may be overhead with a separate signal
  for each lane.</p>

<h2>257</h2>

<p><strong>Amber flashing lights.</strong> These warn of a hazard
  ahead. The signal may show a temporary maximum speed limit, lanes
  that are closed or a message such as &#8216;Fog&#8217;. Adjust your
  speed and look out for the danger until you pass a signal which is
  not flashing or one that gives the &#8216;All clear&#8217; sign and
  you are sure it is safe to increase your speed.</p>

<h2>258</h2>

<p>Red flashing lights. If red lights on the overhead signals flash
  above your lane and a red &#8216;X&#8217; is showing, you
  <strong>MUST NOT</strong> go beyond the signal in that lane. If red
  lights flash on a signal in the central reservation or at the side of
  the road, you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> go beyond the signal in any
  lane.<br />

<h2>268</h2>

<p>Do not overtake on the left or move to a lane on your left to

  a running lane. You will know when you can use this because a speed
  limit sign will be shown above all open lanes, including the hard
  shoulder. A red cross or blank sign above the hard shoulder means
  that you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive on the hard shoulder except

  there may be an incident ahead (see Rule 219). Police officers and
  traffic officers may be required to work in the carriageway, for
  example dealing with debris, collisions or conducting rolling road
  blocks. Police officers will use rear-facing flashing red and blue
  lights and traffic officers will use rear-facing flashing red and

  <li>move uninjured people away from the vehicles to safety; on a
    motorway this should, if possible, be well away from the traffic,
    the hard shoulder and the central reservation</li>

  <li>do not move injured people from their vehicles unless they are in
    immediate danger from fire or explosion</li>

  <li>do not remove a motorcyclist&#8217;s helmet unless it is
    essential to do so</li>

  <li>be prepared to give first aid</li>

  <li>stay at the scene until emergency services arrive. If you are

<h2>291</h2>

<p>A level crossing is where a road crosses a railway or tramway line.
  Approach and cross it with care. Never drive onto a crossing until
  the road is clear on the other side and do not get too close to the
  car in front. Never stop or park on, or near, a crossing.</p>

<h2>Overhead electric lines</h2>

<h2>292</h2>

<p>It is dangerous to touch overhead electric lines. You
  <strong>MUST</strong> obey the safe height warning road signs and you
  should not continue forward onto the railway if your vehicle touches
  any height barrier or bells. The clearance available is usually 5
  metres (16 feet 6 inches) but may be lower.<br />
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36, TSRGD 2002 reg 17(5)</strong></p>

<h2>293</h2>

<p><strong>Controlled Crossings.</strong> Most crossings have traffic
  light signals with a steady amber light, twin flashing red stop
  lights (see &#8216;Light signals controlling traffic&#8217; and
  &#8216;Traffic signs&#8217;) and an audible alarm for pedestrians.
  They may have full, half or no barriers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You MUST always obey the flashing red stop lights.</li>

  <li>You MUST stop behind the white line across the road.</li>

  <li>Keep going if you have already crossed the white line when the
    amber light comes on.</li>

  <li>Do not reverse onto or over a controlled crossing.</li>

  <li>You MUST wait if a train goes by and the red lights continue to
    flash. This means another train will be passing soon.</li>

  <li>Only cross when the lights go off and barriers open.</li>

  <li>Never zig-zag around half-barriers, they lower automatically
    because a train is approaching.</li>

  <li>At crossings where there are no barriers, a train is approaching
    when the lights show.</li>

<h2>294</h2>

<p><strong>Railway telephones.</strong> If you are driving a large or
  slow- moving vehicle, a long, low vehicle with a risk of grounding,
  or herding animals, a train could arrive before you are clear of the
  crossing. You <strong>MUST</strong> obey any sign instructing you to
  use the railway telephone to obtain permission to cross. You
  <strong>MUST</strong> also telephone when clear of the crossing if
  requested to do so.<br />
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10 &amp;
  16(1)</strong></p>

<h2>295</h2>

<p><strong>Crossings without traffic lights.</strong> Vehicles should
  stop and wait at the barrier or gate when it begins to close and not
  cross until the barrier or gate opens.</p>

<h2>296</h2>

<p><strong>User-operated gates or barriers.</strong> Some crossings
  have &#8216;Stop&#8217; signs and small red and green lights. You
  <strong>MUST NOT</strong> cross when the red light is showing, only
  cross if the green light is on. If crossing with a vehicle, you
  should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>open the gates or barriers on both sides of the crossing</li>

  <li>check that the green light is still on and cross quickly</li>

  <li>close the gates or barriers when you are clear of the crossing.</li>

<h2>297</h2>

<p>If there are no lights, follow the procedure in Rule 295. Stop, look
  both ways and listen before you cross. If there is a railway
  telephone, always use it to contact the signal operator to make sure
  it is safe to cross. Inform the signal operator again when you are
  clear of the crossing.</p>

<h2>298</h2>

<p><strong>Open crossings.</strong> These have no gates, barriers,
  attendant or traffic lights but will have a &#8216;Give Way&#8217;
  sign. You should look both ways, listen and make sure there is no
  train coming before you cross.</p>

<h2>299</h2>

<p><strong>Incidents and breakdowns.</strong> If your vehicle breaks
  down, or if you have an incident on a crossing you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get everyone out of the vehicle and clear of the crossing
    immediately</li>

  <li>use a railway telephone if available to tell the signal operator.
    Follow the instructions you are given</li>

  <li>move the vehicle clear of the crossing if there is time before a
    train arrives. If the alarm sounds, or the amber light comes on,
    leave the vehicle and get clear of the crossing immediately.</li>

<header>
<h1>4. Tramways (300 to 307)</h1>
</header>
<h2>300</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> enter a road, lane or other route
  reserved for trams. Take extra care where trams run along the road.
  You should avoid driving directly on top of the rails and should take
  care where trams leave the main carriageway to enter the reserved
  route, to ensure you do not follow them. The width taken up by trams
  is often shown by tram lanes marked by white lines, yellow dots or by
  a different type of road surface. Diamond-shaped signs and white
  light signals give instructions to tram drivers only.<br />
  <strong>Law RTRA sects 5 &amp; 8</strong></p>

<h2>301</h2>

<p>Take extra care where the track crosses from one side of the road to
  the other and where the road narrows and the tracks come close to the
  kerb. Tram drivers usually have their own traffic signals and may be
  permitted to move when you are not. Always give way to trams. Do not
  try to race or overtake them or pass them on the inside, unless they
  are at tram stops or stopped by tram signals and there is a
  designated tram lane for you to pass.</p>

<h2>302</h2>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> park your vehicle where it would get
  in the way of trams or where it would force other drivers to do so.
  Do not stop on any part of a tram track, except in a designated bay
  where this has been provided alongside and clear of the track. When
  doing so, ensure that all parts of your vehicle are outside the
  delineated tram path. Remember that a tram cannot steer round an
  obstruction.<br />
  <strong>Law RTRA sects 5 &amp; 8</strong></p>

<h2>303</h2>

<p><strong>Tram stops.</strong> Where the tram stops at a platform,
  either in the middle or at the side of the road, you
  <strong>MUST</strong> follow the route shown by the road signs and
  markings. At stops without platforms you <strong>MUST NOT</strong>
  drive between a tram and the left-hand kerb when a tram has stopped
  to pick up passengers. If there is no alternative route signed, do
  not overtake the tram - wait until it moves off. <br />
  <strong>Law RTRA sects 5 &amp; 8</strong></p>

<h2>304</h2>

<p>Look out for pedestrians, especially children, running to catch a
  tram approaching a stop.</p>

<h2>305</h2>

<p>Always give priority to trams, especially when they signal to pull
  away from stops, unless it would be unsafe to do so. Remember that
  they may be carrying large numbers of standing passengers who could
  be injured if the tram had to make an emergency stop. Look out for
  people getting off a bus or tram and crossing the road.</p>

<h2>306</h2>

<p>All road users, but particularly cyclists and motorcyclists, should
  take extra care when driving or riding close to or crossing the
  tracks, especially if the rails are wet. You should take particular
  care when crossing the rails at shallow angles, on bends and at
  junctions. It is safest to cross the tracks directly at right angles.
  Other road users should be aware that cyclists and motorcyclists may
  need more space to cross the tracks safely.</p>

<h2>307</h2>

<p><strong>Overhead electric lines.</strong> Tramway overhead wires are
  normally 5.8 metres above any carriageway, but can be lower. You
  should ensure that you have sufficient clearance between the wire and
  your vehicle (including any load you are carrying) before driving
  under an overhead wire. Drivers of vehicles with extending cranes,
  booms, tipping apparatus or other types of variable height equipment
  should ensure that the equipment is fully lowered. Where overhead
  wires are set lower than 5.8 metres, these will be indicated by
  height clearance markings - similar to &#8216;low bridge&#8217;
  signs. The height clearances on these plates should be carefully
  noted and observed. If you are in any doubt as to whether your
  vehicle will pass safely under the wires, you should always contact
  the local police or the tramway operator. Never take a chance as this
  can be extremely hazardous.</p>

<h1>1. Penalties and the Highway Code</h1>
</header>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
  <p>This Highway Code applies to England, Scotland and Wales. The
    Highway Code is essential reading for everyone.</p>
</div>

<p>Parliament sets the maximum penalties for road traffic offences. The
  seriousness of the offence is reflected in the maximum penalty. It is
  for the courts to decide what sentence to impose according to
  circumstances.</p>

<p>The penalty table indicates some of the main offences, and the
  associated penalties. There is a wide range of other more specific
  offences which, for the sake of simplicity, are not shown here. The
  penalty points and disqualification system is described below.</p>
</article> <article class="content-block"
id="penalty-points-and-disqualification"> <header>
<h1>2. Penalty points and disqualification</h1>
</header>
<p>The penalty point system is intended to deter drivers and
  motorcyclists from following unsafe motoring practices. Certain
  non-motoring offences, e.g. failure to rectify vehicle defects, can
  also attract penalty points.</p>

<p>The court <strong>MUST</strong> order points to be endorsed on the
  licence according to the fixed number or the range set by Parliament.
  The accumulation of penalty points acts as a warning to drivers and
  motorcyclists that they risk disqualification if further offences are
  committed.<br />
  <strong>Law RTOA sects 44 &amp; 45</strong></p>

<p>A driver or motorcyclist who accumulates 12 or more penalty points
  within a 3-year period <strong>MUST</strong> be disqualified. This
  will be for a minimum period of 6 months, or longer if the driver or
  motorcyclist has previously been disqualified.<br />
  <strong>Law RTOA sect 35</strong></p>

<p>For every offence which carries penalty points the court has a
  discretionary power to order the licence holder to be disqualified.
  This may be for any period the court thinks fit, but will usually be
  between a week and a few months.</p>

<p>In the case of serious offences, such as dangerous driving and
  drink-driving, the court <strong>MUST</strong> order
  disqualification. The minimum period is 12 months, but for repeat
  offenders or where the alcohol level is high, it may be longer. For
  example, a second drink-drive offence in the space of 10 years will
  result in a minimum of 3 years&#8217; disqualification. <br />

    test is treated as their first driving test. For example a driver
    who exchanges a foreign licence (car) for a UK licence (car) and
    who later passes a test to drive another type of vehicle (e.g. an
    <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr>) will be subject to
    the special rules.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a person subject to the special rules accumulates 6 or more
  penalty points before the end of the 2-year period (including any
  points acquired before passing the test) their licence will be
  revoked automatically. To regain the licence they must reapply for a
  provisional licence and may drive only as a learner until they pass a
  further driving test (also see Annex 8 &#8211; Safety code for new
  drivers. <br />
  <strong>Law RT(ND)A</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note.</strong> This applies even if they pay for offences by
  fixed penalty. Drivers in the first group (UK, <abbr
  title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr
  title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> etc.) who already have a
  full licence for one type of vehicle are not affected by the special
  rules if they later pass a test to drive another type of vehicle.</p>

<h1>5. Other consequences of offending</h1>
</header>
<p>Where an offence is punishable by imprisonment then the vehicle used
  to commit the offence may be confiscated.<br />
  <strong>Law PCC(S)A, sect 143</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the penalties a court may decide to impose, the cost
  of insurance is likely to rise considerably following conviction for
  a serious driving offence. This is because insurance companies
  consider such drivers are more likely to be involved in a collision.</p>

<p>Drivers disqualified for drinking and driving twice within 10 years,
  or once if they are over 2 and a half times the legal limit, or those
  who refused to give a specimen, also have to satisfy the Driver and
  Vehicle Licensing Agency&#8217;s Medical Branch that they do not have
  an alcohol problem and are otherwise fit to drive before their
  licence is returned at the end of their period of disqualification.
  Persistent misuse of drugs or alcohol may lead to the withdrawal of a
  driving licence.</p>

<header>
<h1>1. Vehicle maintenance</h1>
</header>
<p>Take special care that lights, brakes, steering, exhaust system,
  seat belts, demisters, wipers and washers are all working. Also</p>

<ul>
  <li>lights, indicators, reflectors, and number plates
    <strong>MUST</strong> be kept clean and clear</li>

  <li>windscreens and windows <strong>MUST</strong> be kept clean and
    free from obstructions to vision</li>

  <li>lights <strong>MUST</strong> be properly adjusted to prevent
    dazzling other road users.</li>

  <li>Extra attention needs to be paid to this if the vehicle is
    heavily loaded</li>

  <li>exhaust emissions <strong>MUST NOT</strong> exceed prescribed
    levels</li>

  <li>ensure your seat, seat belt, head restraint and mirrors are
    adjusted correctly before you drive</li>

  <li>ensure that items of luggage are securely stowed.<br />
    <strong>Laws RVLR 1989 regs 23 &amp; 27 &amp; CUR 1986, regs 30
    &amp; 61</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Warning displays.</strong> Make sure that you understand the
  meaning of all warning displays on the vehicle instrument panel. Do
  not ignore warning signs, they could indicate a dangerous fault
  developing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you turn the ignition key, warning lights will be
    illuminated but will go out when the engine starts (except the
    handbrake warning light). If they do not, or if they come on while
    you are driving, stop and investigate the problem, as you could
    have a serious fault.</li>

  <li>If the charge warning light comes on while you are driving, it
    may mean that the battery isn&#8217;t charging. This should also be
    checked as soon as possible to avoid loss of power to lights and
    other electrical systems.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Window tints.</strong> You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use a
  vehicle with excessively dark tinting applied to the windscreen, or
  to the glass in any front window to either side of the driver. Window
  tinting applied during manufacture complies with the Visual Light
  Transmittance (VLT) standards. There are no VLT limits for rear
  windscreens or rear passenger windows.<br />
  <strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 42 &amp; CUR reg 32</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tyres.</strong> Tyres <strong>MUST</strong> be correctly
  inflated to the vehicle manufacturer&#8217;s specification for the
  load being carried. Always refer to the vehicle&#8217;s handbook or
  data. Tyres should also be free from certain cuts and other defects.
  Cars, light vans and light trailers <strong>MUST</strong> have a
  tread depth of at least 1.6 mm across the central three-quarters of
  the breadth of the tread and around the entire circumference.
  Motorcycles, large vehicles and passenger-carrying vehicles MUST have
  a tread depth of at least 1 mm across three-quarters of the breadth
  of the tread and in a continuous band around the entire
  circumference. Mopeds should have visible tread. Be aware that some
  vehicle defects can attract penalty points.<br />
  <strong>Law CUR reg 27</strong></p>

<p>If a tyre bursts while you are driving, try to keep control of your
  vehicle. Grip the steering wheel firmly and allow the vehicle to roll
  to a stop at the side of the road.</p>

<p>If you have a flat tyre, stop as soon as it is safe to do so. Only
  change the tyre if you can do so without putting yourself or others
  at risk &#8211; otherwise call a breakdown service.</p>

<p><strong>Tyre pressures.</strong> Check weekly. Do this before your
  journey, when tyres are cold. Warm or hot tyres may give a misleading
  reading.</p>

<p>Your brakes and steering will be adversely affected by
  under-inflated or over-inflated tyres. Excessive or uneven tyre wear
  may be caused by faults in the braking or suspension systems, or
  wheels which are out of alignment. Have these faults corrected as
  soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Fluid levels.</strong> Check the fluid levels in your
  vehicle at least weekly. Low brake fluid may result in brake failure
  and a crash. Make sure you recognise the low fluid warning lights if
  your vehicle has them fitted.</p>

<p><strong>Before winter.</strong> Ensure that the battery is well
  maintained and that there are appropriate anti-freeze agents in your
  radiator and windscreen bottle.</p>

<p><strong>Other problems.</strong> If your vehicle</p>

<ul>
  <li>pulls to one side when braking, it is most likely to be a brake
    fault or incorrectly inflated tyres. Consult a garage or mechanic
    immediately</li>

  <li>continues to bounce after pushing down on the front or rear, its
    shock absorbers are worn. Worn shock absorbers can seriously affect
    the operation of a vehicle and should be replaced</li>

  <li>smells of anything unusual such as burning rubber, petrol or an
    electrical fault; investigate immediately. Do not risk a fire.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overheated engines or fire.</strong> Most engines are
  water-cooled. If your engine overheats you should wait until it has
  cooled naturally. Only then remove the coolant filler cap and add
  water or other coolant.</p>

<p>If your vehicle catches fire, get the occupants out of the vehicle
  quickly and to a safe place. Do not attempt to extinguish a fire in
  the engine compartment, as opening the bonnet will make the fire
  flare. Call the fire brigade.</p>

<p><strong>Petrol stations/fuel tank/fuel leaks.</strong> Ensure that,
  when filling up your vehicle&#8217;s tank or any fuel cans you are
  carrying, you do not spill fuel on the forecourt. Any spilled fuel
  should be immediately reported to the petrol station attendant.
  Diesel spillage is dangerous to other road users, particularly
  motorcyclists, as it will significantly reduce the level of grip
  between the tyres and road surface. Double-check for fuel leaks and
  make sure that - you do not overfill your fuel tank - the fuel cap is
  fastened securely - the seal in the cap is not torn, perished or
  missing - there is no visual damage to the cap or the fuel tank</p>

<p>Emergency fuel caps, if fitted, should form a good seal.</p>

<p>Never smoke, or use a mobile phone, on the forecourt of petrol
  stations as these are major fire risks and could cause an explosion.</p>

<h1>2. Vehicle security</h1>
</header>
<p>When you leave your vehicle you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>remove the ignition key and engage the steering lock</li>

  <li>lock the car, even if you only leave it for a few minutes</li>

  <li>close the windows completely</li>

  <li>never leave children or pets in an unventilated car</li>

  <li>take all contents with you, or lock them in the boot. Remember,
    for all a thief knows a carrier bag may contain valuables</li>

  <li>never leave vehicle documents in the car.</li>
</ul>

<p>For extra security fit an anti-theft device such as an alarm or
  immobiliser. If you are buying a new car it is a good idea to check
  the level of built-in security features. Consider having your
  registration number etched on all your car windows. This is a cheap
  and effective deterrent to professional thieves.</p>
